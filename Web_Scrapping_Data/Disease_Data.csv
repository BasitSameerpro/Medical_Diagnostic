9q34 deletion syndrome,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9q34_deletion_syndrome,0–9,"9q34 deletion syndrome  is a rare genetic disorder. Terminal deletions of chromosome 9q34 have been associated with childhood hypotonia, a distinctive facial appearance and developmental disability. The facial features typically described include arched eyebrows, small head circumference, midface hypoplasia, prominent jaw and a pouting lower lip. Individuals with this disease may often have speech impediments, such as speech delays. Other characteristics of this disease include: epilepsy, congenital and urogenital defects, microcephaly, corpulence, and psychiatric disorders.[1] From analysis of chromosomal breakpoints, as well as gene sequencing in suggestive cases, Kleefstra and colleagues identified EHMT1 as the causative gene.[4]
This gene is responsible for producing the protein histone methyltransferase which functions to alter histones. Ultimately, histone methyltransferases are important in deactivating certain genes, needed for proper growth and development. Moreover, a frameshift, missense, or nonsense error in the coding sequence of EHMT1 can result in this condition in an individual.[3]

8p23.1 duplication syndrome,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8p23.1_duplication_syndrome,0–9,"8p23.1 duplication syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by a duplication of a region from human chromosome 8.[1] This duplication syndrome has an estimated prevalence of 1 in 64,000 births[1] and is the reciprocal of the 8p23.1 deletion syndrome. The 8p23.1 duplication is associated with a variable phenotype including one or more of speech delay, developmental delay, mild dysmorphism, with prominent forehead and arched eyebrows, and congenital heart disease (CHD).[2][3]

Taste disorder,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste_disorder,T,"Dysgeusia, also known as parageusia, is a distortion of the sense of taste. Dysgeusia is also often associated with ageusia, which is the complete lack of taste, and hypogeusia, which is a decrease in taste sensitivity.[1] An alteration in taste or smell may be a secondary process in various disease states, or it may be the primary symptom. The distortion in the sense of taste is the only symptom, and diagnosis is usually complicated since the sense of taste is tied together with other sensory systems. Common causes of dysgeusia include chemotherapy, asthma treatment with albuterol, and zinc deficiency. Liver disease, hypothyroidism, and rarely, certain types of seizures can also lead to dysgeusia. Different drugs can also be responsible for altering taste and resulting in dysgeusia. Due to the variety of causes of dysgeusia, there are many possible treatments that are effective in alleviating or terminating the symptoms. These include artificial saliva, pilocarpine, zinc supplementation, alterations in drug therapy, and alpha lipoic acid.

Hypokalemic periodic paralysis type 1,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypokalemic_periodic_paralysis_type_1,H,"Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoKPP), also known as familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis (FHPP),[1] is a rare, autosomal dominant channelopathy characterized by muscle weakness or paralysis when there is a fall in potassium levels in the blood (hypokalemia). In individuals with this mutation, attacks sometimes begin in adolescence and most commonly occur with individual triggers such as rest after strenuous exercise (attacks during exercise are rare), high carbohydrate meals, meals with high sodium content, sudden changes in temperature, and even excitement, noise, flashing lights, cold temperatures and stress. Weakness may be mild and limited to certain muscle groups, or more severe full-body paralysis. During an attack, reflexes may be decreased or absent. Attacks may last for a few hours or persist for several days. Recovery is usually sudden when it occurs, due to release of potassium from swollen muscles as they recover. Some patients may fall into an abortive attack or develop chronic muscle weakness later in life.

Due to the nearly absent or nonfunctional streak ovaries (under-developed ovaries that are then small and fibrous tissue, hence the term ""streak""),[2] the individual is low in estrogen levels (hypoestrogenic) and has high levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), hormones that cycle in the reproductive system.[3] As a result, the diagnosis often occurs after a concern for delayed puberty or amenorrhea. Treatment generally involves hormone replacement therapy with estrogen and progesterone.[4]

Glycosuria,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosuria,G,"Glycosuria is the excretion of glucose into the urine. Ordinarily, urine contains no glucose because the kidneys are able to reabsorb all of the filtered glucose from the tubular fluid back into the bloodstream. Glycosuria is nearly always caused by an elevated blood sugar level, most commonly due to untreated diabetes. Rarely, glycosuria is due to an intrinsic problem with glucose reabsorption within the kidneys (such as Fanconi syndrome), producing a condition termed renal glycosuria.[1] Glycosuria leads to excessive water loss into the urine with resultant dehydration, a process called osmotic diuresis.

Therefore, glycogen is not made properly, and abnormal glycogen molecules accumulate in cells; most severely in cardiac and muscle cells. The severity of this disease varies on the amount of enzyme produced. GSD IV is autosomal recessive, which means each parent has a mutant copy of the gene but shows no symptoms of the disease. Having an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, males and females are equally likely to be affected by Andersen's disease. Classic Andersen's disease typically becomes apparent during the first few months after the patient is born. Approximately 1 in 20,000 to 25,000 newborns have a glycogen storage disease.[4] Andersen's disease affects 1 in 800,000 individuals worldwide, with 3% of all GSDs being type IV.[5] The disease was described and studied first by Dorothy Hansine Andersen.[6][7]

It may be caused by such things as certain medications, pituitary disorders and thyroid disorders. The condition can occur in males as well as females. Relatively common etiologies include prolactinoma, medication effect, kidney failure, granulomatous diseases of the pituitary gland, and disorders which interfere with the hypothalamic inhibition of prolactin release. Ectopic (non-pituitary) production of prolactin may also occur. Galactorrhea hyperprolactinemia is listed as a “rare disease” by the Office of Rare Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. This means that it affects less than 200,000 people in the United States population.[1]

Galactokinase deficiency,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactokinase_deficiency,G,"Galactokinase deficiency is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder marked by an accumulation of galactose and galactitol secondary to the decreased conversion of galactose to galactose-1-phosphate by galactokinase.[2] The disorder is caused by mutations in the GALK1 gene, located on chromosome 17q24.[1]  Galactokinase catalyzes the first step of galactose phosphorylation in the Leloir pathway of intermediate metabolism.  Galactokinase deficiency is one of the three inborn errors of metabolism that lead to hypergalactosemia.  The disorder is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Unlike classic galactosemia, which is caused by a deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase, galactokinase deficiency does not present with severe manifestations in early infancy. Its major clinical symptom is the development of cataracts during the first weeks or months of life, as a result of the accumulation, in the lens, of galactitol, a product of an alternative route of galactose utilization. The development of early cataracts in homozygous affected infants is fully preventable through early diagnosis and treatment with a galactose-restricted diet. Some studies have suggested that, depending on milk consumption later in life, heterozygous carriers of galactokinase deficiency may be prone to presenile cataracts at 20–50 years of age.[3]

Galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase deficiency,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactose-1-phosphate_uridylyltransferase_deficiency,G,"Galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase deficiency (classic galactosemia) is the most common type of galactosemia, an inborn error of galactose metabolism, caused by a deficiency of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase.[1] It is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that can cause liver disease and death if untreated.  Treatment of galactosemia is most successful if initiated early and includes dietary restriction of lactose intake.  Because early intervention is key, galactosemia is included in newborn screening programs in many areas.  On initial screening, which often involves measuring the concentration of galactose in blood, classic galactosemia may be indistinguishable from other inborn errors of galactose metabolism, including galactokinase deficiency and galactose epimerase deficiency.  Further analysis of metabolites and enzyme activities are needed to identify the specific metabolic error.

"Fibrinogen deficiency, congenital","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrinogen_deficiency,_congenital",F,"Congenital hypofibrinogenemia is a rare disorder in which one of the three genes responsible for producing fibrinogen, a critical blood clotting factor, is unable to make a functional fibrinogen glycoprotein because of an inherited mutation. In consequence, liver cells, the normal site of fibrinogen production, make small amounts of this critical coagulation protein, blood levels of fibrinogen are low, and individuals with the disorder may develop a coagulopathy, i.e. a diathesis or propensity to experience episodes of abnormal bleeding. However, individuals with congenital hypofibrinogenemia may also have episodes of abnormal blood clot formation, i.e. thrombosis. This seemingly paradoxical propensity to develop thrombosis in a disorder causing a decrease in a critical protein for blood clotting may be due to the function of fibrin (the split product of fibrinogen that is the basis for forming blood clots) to promote the lysis or disintegration of blood clots. Lower levels of fibrin may reduce the lysis of early fibrin strand depositions and thereby allow these depositions to develop into clots.[1]

However, this disorder is far more common within infants, and porencephaly can occur both before or after birth.[2]

Familial polyposis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familial_polyposis,F,"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant inherited condition in which numerous adenomatous polyps form mainly in the epithelium of the large intestine. While these polyps start out benign, malignant transformation into colon cancer occurs when they are left untreated. Three variants are known to exist, FAP and attenuated FAP (originally called hereditary flat adenoma syndrome[1]) are caused by APC gene defects on chromosome 5 while autosomal recessive FAP (or MUTYH-associated polyposis) is caused by defects in the MUTYH gene on chromosome 1. Of the three, FAP itself is the most severe and most common; although for all three, the resulting colonic polyps and cancers are initially confined to the colon wall. Detection and removal before metastasis outside the colon can greatly reduce and in many cases eliminate the spread of cancer.

Familial aortic dissection,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familial_aortic_dissection,F,"Familial aortic dissection or FAD refers to the splitting of the wall of the aorta in either the arch, ascending or descending portions. FAD is thought to be passed down as an autosomal dominant disease and once inherited will result in dissection of the aorta, and dissecting aneurysm of the aorta, or rarely aortic or arterial dilation at a young age. Dissection refers to the tearing of the aortic wall, resulting in the separation of its layers. However, the exact gene(s) involved has not yet been identified.[1] It can occur in the absence of clinical features of Marfan syndrome and of systemic hypertension.[2][3][4][5][6] Over time this weakness, along with systolic pressure, results in a tear in the aortic intima layer thus allowing blood to enter between the layers of tissue and cause further tearing. Eventually complete rupture of the aorta occurs and the pleural cavity fills with blood. Warning signs include chest pain, ischemia, and hemorrhaging in the chest cavity. This condition, unless found and treated early, usually results in death. Immediate surgery is the best treatment in most cases.[7] FAD is not to be confused with PAU (penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers) and IMH (intramural hematoma), both of which present in ways similar to that of familial aortic dissection.[8]

Interstitial lung disease,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstitial_lung_disease,I,"Interstitial lung disease (ILD), or diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD),[3] is a group of respiratory diseases affecting the interstitium (the tissue) and space around the alveoli (air sacs) of the lungs.[4] It concerns alveolar epithelium, pulmonary capillary endothelium, basement membrane, and perivascular and perilymphatic tissues. It may occur when an injury to the lungs triggers an abnormal healing response. Ordinarily, the body generates just the right amount of tissue to repair damage, but in interstitial lung disease, the repair process is disrupted, and the tissue around the air sacs (alveoli) becomes scarred and thickened. This makes it more difficult for oxygen to pass into the bloodstream. The disease presents itself with the following symptoms: shortness of breath, nonproductive coughing, fatigue, and weight loss, which tend to develop slowly, over several months. The average rate of survival for someone with this disease is between three and five years.[5] The term ILD is used to distinguish these diseases from obstructive airways diseases.

Intraocular lymphoma,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraocular_lymphoma,I,"Intraocular lymphoma is a rare malignant form of eye cancer. Intraocular lymphoma may affect the eye secondarily from a metastasis from a non-ocular tumor or may arise within the eye primarily (primary intraocular lymphoma, PIOL). PIOL is a subset of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL (and PIOL) are most commonly a diffuse large B-cell immunohistologic subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lymphomas. The most common symptoms of PIOL include blurred or decreased vision due to tumor cells in the vitreous. Most cases of PIOL eventuate to central nervous system involvement (PCNSL) while only 20% of PCNSL lead to intraocular (PIOL) involvement. PIOL and PCNSL remain enigmas because both structures are immunologically privileged sites (the brain sits behind the blood–brain barrier and the retina sits behind the blood-retinal barrier) and so do not normally have immune cells trafficking through these structures. What is more, while the vast majority of PCNSL in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is related to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the development of PCNSL and PIOL in immunocompetent patients is unknown and shows no general relation to infectious DNAs.[1]

Müllerian agenesis (including absence of the uterus, cervix and/or vagina) is the cause in 15% of cases of primary amenorrhoea.[2] Because most of the vagina does not develop from the Müllerian duct, instead developing from the urogenital sinus, along with the bladder and urethra, it is present even when the Müllerian duct is completely absent. Because ovaries do not develop from the Müllerian ducts, affected people might have normal secondary sexual characteristics but are infertile due to the lack of a functional uterus. However, biological motherhood is possible through uterus transplantation or use of gestational surrogates.

"
Inclusion-cell disease,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion-cell_disease,I,"Inclusion-cell (I-cell) disease, also referred to as mucolipidosis II (ML II),[1][2] is part of the lysosomal storage disease family and results from a defective phosphotransferase (an enzyme of the Golgi apparatus). This enzyme transfers phosphate to mannose residues on specific proteins. Mannose-6-phosphate serves as a marker for proteins to be targeted to lysosomes within the cell. Without this marker, proteins are instead secreted outside the cell, which is the default pathway for proteins moving through the Golgi apparatus. Lysosomes cannot function without these proteins, which function as catabolic enzymes for the normal breakdown of substances (e.g. oligosaccharides, lipids, and glycosaminoglycans)[3] in various tissues throughout the body (i.e. fibroblasts). As a result, a buildup of these substances occurs within lysosomes because they cannot be degraded, resulting in the characteristic I-cells, or ""inclusion cells"" seen microscopically. In addition, the defective lysosomal enzymes normally found only within lysosomes are instead found in high concentrations in the blood, but they remain inactive at blood pH (around 7.4) because they require the low lysosomal pH 5 to function.

Inborn errors of metabolism are often referred to as congenital metabolic diseases or inherited metabolic disorders.[2] Another term used to describe these disorders is ""enzymopathies"". This term was created following the study of biodynamic enzymology, a science based on the study of the enzymes and their products. Finally, inborn errors of metabolism were studied for the first time by British physician Archibald Garrod (1857–1936), in 1908. He is known for work that prefigured the ""one gene–one enzyme"" hypothesis, based on his studies on the nature and inheritance of alkaptonuria. His seminal text, Inborn Errors of Metabolism, was published in 1923.[3]

However, the disease can seem to re-present a second time with further vision loss due to the early onset of presbyopia symptoms (i.e., difficulty in viewing objects up close).[1] DOA is characterized as affecting neurons called retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). This condition is due to mitochondrial dysfunction mediating the death of optic nerve fibers. The RGCs axons form the optic nerve. Therefore, the disease can be considered of the central nervous system.[2] Dominant optic atrophy was first described clinically by Batten in 1896 and named Kjer’s optic neuropathy in 1959 after Danish ophthalmologist Poul Kjer, who studied 19 families with the disease.[3]  Although dominant optic atrophy is the most common autosomally inherited optic neuropathy (i.e., disease of the optic nerves), it is often misdiagnosed.

corpus striatum.[2]  This symptom does not occur alone and is often accompanied by the symptoms of cerebral palsy, as it is often a result of this physical disability.  Treatments for athetosis are not very effective, and in most cases are simply aimed at managing the uncontrollable movement, rather than the cause itself.[citation needed]

The most common symptoms include cough, fever, difficulty breathing, and sweating at night. Eosinophilic pneumonia is diagnosed by a combination of characteristic symptoms, findings on a physical examination by a health provider, and the results of blood tests and X-rays. Prognosis is excellent once most eosinophilic pneumonia is recognized and treatment with corticosteroids is begun.

Keloids are firm, rubbery lesions or shiny, fibrous nodules, and can vary from pink to the color of the person's skin or red to dark brown. A keloid scar is benign and not contagious, but sometimes accompanied by severe itchiness, pain,[2] and changes in texture. In severe cases, it can affect the movement of the skin. In the United States, keloid scars are seen 15 times more frequently in people of sub-Saharan African descent than in people of European descent.[3] There is a higher tendency to develop a keloid among those with a family history of keloids and people between the ages of 10 and 30 years.[4]

I cell disease,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_cell_disease,I,"Inclusion-cell (I-cell) disease, also referred to as mucolipidosis II (ML II),[1][2] is part of the lysosomal storage disease family and results from a defective phosphotransferase (an enzyme of the Golgi apparatus). This enzyme transfers phosphate to mannose residues on specific proteins. Mannose-6-phosphate serves as a marker for proteins to be targeted to lysosomes within the cell. Without this marker, proteins are instead secreted outside the cell, which is the default pathway for proteins moving through the Golgi apparatus. Lysosomes cannot function without these proteins, which function as catabolic enzymes for the normal breakdown of substances (e.g. oligosaccharides, lipids, and glycosaminoglycans)[3] in various tissues throughout the body (i.e. fibroblasts). As a result, a buildup of these substances occurs within lysosomes because they cannot be degraded, resulting in the characteristic I-cells, or ""inclusion cells"" seen microscopically. In addition, the defective lysosomal enzymes normally found only within lysosomes are instead found in high concentrations in the blood, but they remain inactive at blood pH (around 7.4) because they require the low lysosomal pH 5 to function.

The condition is usually diagnosed using an electrocardiogram, but genetic testing can also be used. Treatment includes lifestyle measures, beta blockers, and implantation of a defibrillator in some cases. It was first described by Anton Jervell and Fred Lange-Nielsen in 1957.[3]

Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism-anosmia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogonadotropic_hypogonadism-anosmia,H,"Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH),  is due to problems with either the hypothalamus or pituitary gland affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG axis).[1]  Hypothalamic disorders result from a deficiency in the release of gonadotropic releasing hormone (GnRH), while pituitary gland disorders are due to a deficiency in the release of gonadotropins from the anterior pituitary.[1] GnRH is the central regulator in reproductive function and sexual development via the HPG axis. GnRH is released by GnRH neurons, which are hypothalamic neuroendocrine cells, into the hypophyseal portal system acting on gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary.[1]
The release of gonadotropins, LH and FSH, act on the gonads for the development and maintenance of proper adult reproductive physiology. LH acts on Leydig cells in the male testes and theca cells in the female. FSH acts on Sertoli cells in the male and follicular cells in the female. Combined this causes the secretion of gonadal sex steroids and the initiation of folliculogenesis and spermatogenesis. The production of sex steroids forms a negative feedback loop acting on both the anterior pituitary and hypothalamus causing a pulsatile secretion of GnRH.[1]
GnRH neurons lack sex steroid receptors and mediators such as kisspeptin stimulate GnRH neurons for pulsatile secretion of GnRH.[2]

GnRH is released by GnRH neurons, which are hypothalamic neuroendocrine cells, into the hypophyseal portal system acting on gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary.[1]
The release of gonadotropins, LH and FSH, act on the gonads for the development and maintenance of proper adult reproductive physiology. LH acts on Leydig cells in the male testes and theca cells in the female. FSH acts on Sertoli cells in the male and follicular cells in the female. Combined this causes the secretion of gonadal sex steroids and the initiation of folliculogenesis and spermatogenesis. The production of sex steroids forms a negative feedback loop acting on both the anterior pituitary and hypothalamus causing a pulsatile secretion of GnRH.[1]
GnRH neurons lack sex steroid receptors and mediators such as kisspeptin stimulate GnRH neurons for pulsatile secretion of GnRH.[2]

"Hypofibrinogenemia, familial","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypofibrinogenemia,_familial",H,"Congenital hypofibrinogenemia is a rare disorder in which one of the three genes responsible for producing fibrinogen, a critical blood clotting factor, is unable to make a functional fibrinogen glycoprotein because of an inherited mutation. In consequence, liver cells, the normal site of fibrinogen production, make small amounts of this critical coagulation protein, blood levels of fibrinogen are low, and individuals with the disorder may develop a coagulopathy, i.e. a diathesis or propensity to experience episodes of abnormal bleeding. However, individuals with congenital hypofibrinogenemia may also have episodes of abnormal blood clot formation, i.e. thrombosis. This seemingly paradoxical propensity to develop thrombosis in a disorder causing a decrease in a critical protein for blood clotting may be due to the function of fibrin (the split product of fibrinogen that is the basis for forming blood clots) to promote the lysis or disintegration of blood clots. Lower levels of fibrin may reduce the lysis of early fibrin strand depositions and thereby allow these depositions to develop into clots.[1]

There are three steps that lead to this response.[1] The first step is immune complex formation, which involves the binding of antigens to antibodies to form mobile immune complexes. The second step is immune complex deposition, during which the complexes leave the plasma and are deposited into tissues. Finally, the third step is the inflammatory reaction, during which the classical pathway is activated and macrophages and neutrophils are recruited to the affected tissues. Such reactions may progress to immune complex diseases.

In regard to the frequency, less than 1% of varicella zoster infections involve the facial nerve and result in RHS.[1] It is traditionally defined as a triad of ipsilateral facial paralysis, otalgia, and vesicles close to the ear and auditory canal. Due to its proximity to the vestibulocochlear nerve, the virus can spread and cause hearing loss, tinnitus (hearing noises that are not caused by outside sounds), and vertigo. It is common for diagnoses to be overlooked or delayed, which can raise the likelihood of long-term consequences. It is more complicated than Bell's palsy. Therapy aims to shorten its overall length, while also providing pain relief and averting any consequences.

Hemoglobin C disease,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin_C_disease,H,"Hemoglobin C (abbreviated as HbC) is an abnormal hemoglobin in which glutamic acid residue at the 6th position of the β-globin chain is replaced with a lysine residue due to a point mutation in the HBB gene.[1] People with one copy of the gene for hemoglobin C do not experience symptoms, but can pass the abnormal gene on to their children. Those with two copies of the gene are said to have hemoglobin C disease and can experience mild anemia. It is possible for a person to have both the gene for hemoglobin S (the form associated with sickle cell anemia) and the gene for hemoglobin C; this state is called hemoglobin SC disease, and is generally more severe than hemoglobin C disease, but milder than sickle cell anemia.[2]

Hemochromatosis type 3,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemochromatosis_type_3,H,"Haemochromatosis type 3 is a type of iron overload disorder associated with deficiencies in transferrin receptor 2. It exhibits an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.[2][3][4] The first confirmed case was diagnosed in 1865 by French doctor Trousseau. Later in 1889, the German doctor von Recklinghausen indicated that the liver contains iron, and due to bleeding being considered to be the cause, he called the pigment ""Haemochromatosis.""[5] In 1935, English doctor Sheldon's groundbreaking book titled, Haemochromatosis, reviewed 311 patient case reports and presented the idea that haemochromatosis was a congenital metabolic disorder.[5] Hereditary haemochromatosis is a congenital disorder which affects the regulation of iron metabolism thus causing increased gut absorption of iron and a gradual build-up of pathologic iron deposits in the liver and other internal organs, joint capsules and the skin.[5] The iron overload could potentially cause serious disease from the age of 40–50 years. In the final stages of the disease, the major symptoms include liver cirrhosis, diabetes and bronze-colored skin. There are four types of hereditary hemochromatosis which are classified depending on the age of onset and other factors such as genetic cause and mode of inheritance.[6]

Hemochromatosis type 2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_hemochromatosis,H,"Juvenile hemochromatosis, also known as hemochromatosis type 2, is a rare form of hereditary hemochromatosis, which emerges in young individuals, typically between 15 and 30 years of age, but occasionally later.[1][2] It is characterized by an inability to control how much iron is absorbed by the body, in turn leading to iron overload, where excess iron accumulates in many areas of the body and causes damage to the places it accumulates.[1][3]
"
Hemochromatosis type 4,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemochromatosis_type_4,H,"Hemochromatosis type 4 is a hereditary iron overload disorder that affects ferroportin, an iron transport protein needed to export iron from cells into circulation.[1]  Although the disease is rare, it is found throughout the world and affects people from various ethnic groups.  While the majority of individuals with type 4 hemochromatosis have a relatively mild form of the disease, some affected individuals have a more severe form. As the disease progresses, iron may accumulate in the tissues of affected individuals over time, potentially resulting in organ damage.[2]

Investigators speculate that the antibodies interfere with phospholipids used to induce in vitro coagulation. In vivo, the antibodies are thought to interact with platelet membrane phospholipids, increasing adhesion and aggregation of platelets, which accounts for the in vivo prothrombotic characteristics.[2]

The lack and impairment of insulin receptor functionality leads to an inability to regulate blood glucose levels through severe insulin resistance. This will ultimately lead to affected development of tissues and organs throughout the body. In addition to the physical abnormalities, leprechaunism is also characterized by endocrine system abnormalities that can lead to conditions such as hyperglycemia (high blood glucose levels), hypoglycemia (low blood glucose levels), hyperinsulemia (high blood insulin levels), and the enlargement of certain sex organs such as the penis in males, and the clitoris in females.

Myofibroblastic tumors,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myofibroblastic_tumors,M,"Fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors (FMTs) are tumors which develop from the mesenchymal stem cells which differentiate into fibroblasts (the most common cell type in connective tissue) and/or the myocytes/myoblasts that differentiate into muscle cells. FMTs are a heterogeneous group of soft tissue neoplasms (i.e. abnormal and excessive tissue growths). The World Health Organization (2020) defined tumors as being FMTs based on their morphology and, more importantly, newly discovered abnormalities in the expression levels of key gene products made by these tumors' neoplastic cells.[1] Histopathologically, FMTs consist of neoplastic connective tissue cells which have differented into cells that have microscopic appearances resembling fibroblasts and/or myofibroblasts. The fibroblastic cells are characterized as spindle-shaped cells with inconspicuous nucleoli that express vimentin, an intracellular protein typically found in mesenchymal cells, and CD34, a cell surface membrane glycoprotein. Myofibroblastic cells are plumper with more abundant cytoplasm and more prominent nucleoli; they express smooth muscle marker proteins such as smooth muscle actins, desmin, and caldesmon.[2] The World Health Organization further classified FMTs into four tumor forms based on their varying levels of aggressiveness: benign, intermediate (locally aggressive), intermediate (rarely metastasizing), and malignant.[1]

Myoclonus (myo- ""muscle"", clonus ""spasm"") describes a medical sign and, generally, is not a diagnosis of a disease. It belongs to the hyperkinetic movement disorders, among tremor and chorea for example. These myoclonic twitches, jerks, or seizures are usually caused by sudden muscle contractions (positive myoclonus) or brief lapses of contraction (negative myoclonus).  The most common circumstance under which they occur is while falling asleep (hypnic jerk).  Myoclonic jerks occur in healthy people and are experienced occasionally by everyone.  However, when they appear with more persistence and become more widespread they can be a sign of various neurological disorders.  Hiccups are a kind of myoclonic jerk specifically affecting the diaphragm.  When a spasm is caused by another person it is known as a provoked spasm.  Shuddering attacks in babies fall in this category.

Most PMEs are caused by autosomal dominant or recessive and mitochondrial mutations.[2] The location of the mutation also affects the inheritance and treatment of PME. Diagnosing PME is difficult due to their genetic heterogeneity and the lack of a genetic mutation identified in some patients.[3] The prognosis depends largely on the worsening symptoms and failure to respond to treatment. There is no current cure for PME and treatment focuses on managing myoclonus and seizures through antiepileptic medication (AED).[3][2]

The causes of MERRF syndrome are difficult to determine, but because it is a mitochondrial disorder, it can be caused by the mutation of nuclear DNA or mitochondrial DNA.[3] The classification of this disease varies from patient to patient, since many individuals do not fall into one specific disease category. The primary features displayed on a person with MERRF include myoclonus, seizures, cerebellar ataxia, myopathy,[3] and ragged red fibers (RRF) on muscle biopsy, leading to the disease's name.

This impairment is classified by deficiencies in expressive and receptive language development that is not attributed to sensory deficits, nonverbal intellectual deficits, a neurological condition, environmental deprivation or psychiatric impairments.[3][4] Research illustrates that 2% to 4% of five year olds have mixed receptive-expressive language disorder. This distinction is made when children have issues in expressive language skills, the production of language, and when children also have issues in receptive language skills, the understanding of language. Those with mixed receptive-language disorder have a normal left-right anatomical asymmetry of the planum temporale and parietale. This is attributed to a reduced left hemisphere functional specialization for language. Taken from a measure of cerebral blood flow (SPECT) in phonemic discrimination tasks, children with mixed receptive-expressive language disorder do not exhibit the expected predominant left hemisphere activation.[5] Mixed receptive-expressive language disorder is also known as receptive-expressive language impairment (RELI) or receptive language disorder.[6]

It may occur when an injury to the lungs triggers an abnormal healing response. Ordinarily, the body generates just the right amount of tissue to repair damage, but in interstitial lung disease, the repair process is disrupted, and the tissue around the air sacs (alveoli) becomes scarred and thickened. This makes it more difficult for oxygen to pass into the bloodstream. The disease presents itself with the following symptoms: shortness of breath, nonproductive coughing, fatigue, and weight loss, which tend to develop slowly, over several months. The average rate of survival for someone with this disease is between three and five years.[5] The term ILD is used to distinguish these diseases from obstructive airways diseases.

Visceral organs, including the kidneys, heart, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract can also be affected by the fibrotic process.
Prognosis is determined by the form of the disease and the extent of visceral involvement. Patients with limited systemic sclerosis have a better prognosis than those with the diffuse form. Death is most often caused by lung, heart, and kidney involvement. The risk of cancer is increased slightly.[1]

Müllerian agenesis (including absence of the uterus, cervix and/or vagina) is the cause in 15% of cases of primary amenorrhoea.[2] Because most of the vagina does not develop from the Müllerian duct, instead developing from the urogenital sinus, along with the bladder and urethra, it is present even when the Müllerian duct is completely absent. Because ovaries do not develop from the Müllerian ducts, affected people might have normal secondary sexual characteristics but are infertile due to the lack of a functional uterus. However, biological motherhood is possible through uterus transplantation or use of gestational surrogates.

Several reports have linked the syndrome to a mutation in the FBN1 gene, but these cases do not resemble those initially described in the medical literature in 1982 by Shprintzen and Goldberg,[2] and Greally et al. in 1998 failed to find a causal link to FBN1.[3] At this time, the cause of Shprintzen–Goldberg syndrome has been identified as a mutation in the gene SKI located on chromosome 1 at the p36 locus. The syndrome is rare with fewer than 50 cases described in the medical literature to date.[citation needed]

Globodontia is an abnormal condition that can occur in both the primary and secondary dentition, except for the incisors which are normal in shape and size.[1][2][3] This is demonstrated by significant enlargement of the canine and molar teeth.[1] The premolars are either reduced in size or are absent.[3] In some cases, the defects affecting the teeth, eye and ear can be either individual or combined.[4] When these conditions are combined with eye coloboma, the condition is also known as oculo-otodental syndrome. The first known case of otodental syndrome was found in Hungary in a mother and her son by Denes and Csiba in 1969.[5] Prevalence is less than 1 out of every 1 million individuals.[2]
The cause of otodental syndrome is considered to be genetic. It is an autosomal dominant inheritance and is variable in its expressivity.[6] Haploinsufficiency in the fibroblast growth factor 3 (FGF3) gene (11q13) has been reported in patients with otodental syndrome and is thought to cause the phenotype.[2] Both males and females are equally affected. Individuals diagnosed with otodental syndrome can be of any age; age is not a relevant factor.

Myotonia causes muscle stiffness, often painful, that worsens after exercise and may be aggravated by eating potassium-rich foods such as bananas and potatoes. Stiffness occurs in skeletal muscles throughout the body. Potassium-aggravated myotonia ranges in severity from mild episodes of muscle stiffness to severe, disabling disease with frequent attacks. Potassium-aggravated myotonia may, in some cases, also cause paradoxical myotonia, in which myotonia becomes more severe at the time of movement instead of after movement has ceased.

Postural hypotension,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postural_hypotension,P,"Orthostatic hypotension, also known as postural hypotension,[2] is a medical condition wherein a person's blood pressure drops when they are standing up (orthostasis) or sitting down. Primary orthostatic hypotension is also often referred to as neurogenic orthostatic hypotension.[3] The drop in blood pressure may be sudden (vasovagal orthostatic hypotension), within 3 minutes (classic orthostatic hypotension) or gradual (delayed orthostatic hypotension).[4] It is defined as a fall in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg after 3 minutes of standing. It occurs predominantly by delayed (or absent) constriction of the lower body blood vessels, which is normally required to maintain adequate blood pressure when changing the position to standing. As a result, blood pools in the blood vessels of the legs for a longer period, and less is returned to the heart, thereby leading to a reduced cardiac output and inadequate blood flow to the brain.

Symptoms include eye pain, eye redness, floaters and blurred vision, and ophthalmic examination may show dilated ciliary blood vessels and the presence of cells in the anterior chamber. Uveitis may arise spontaneously, have a genetic component, or be associated with an autoimmune disease or infection. While the eye is a relatively protected environment, its immune mechanisms may be activated resulting in inflammation and tissue destruction associated with T-cell activation.

"Night blindness, congenital stationary","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_blindness,_congenital_stationary",N,"Congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) is a rare non-progressive retinal disorder. People with CSNB often have difficulty adapting to low light situations due to impaired photoreceptor transmission. These patients may also have reduced visual acuity, myopia, nystagmus, fundus abnormalities, and strabismus.[1][2] CSNB has two forms -- complete, also known as type-1 (CSNB1), and incomplete, also known as type-2 (CSNB2), which are distinguished by the involvement of different retinal pathways. In CSNB1, downstream neurons called  bipolar cells are unable to detect neurotransmission from photoreceptor cells. CSNB1 can be caused by mutations in various genes involved in neurotransmitter detection, including NYX. In CSNB2, the photoreceptors themselves have impaired neurotransmission function; this is caused primarily by mutations in the gene CACNA1F, which encodes a voltage-gated calcium channel important for neurotransmitter release. CSNB has been identified in horses and dogs as the result of mutations in  TRPM1 (Horse, ""LP"")[3], GRM6 (Horse, ""CSNB2"")[4], and LRIT3 (Dog, CSNB)[5].

Neurotoxicity syndromes,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity_syndrome,N,"Neurotoxicity is a form of toxicity in which a biological, chemical, or physical agent produces an adverse effect on the structure or function of the central and/or peripheral nervous system.[1] It occurs when exposure to a substance – specifically, a neurotoxin or neurotoxicant– alters the normal activity of the nervous system in such a way as to cause permanent or reversible damage to nervous tissue.[1] This can eventually disrupt or even kill neurons, which are cells that transmit and process signals in the brain and other parts of the nervous system. Neurotoxicity can result from organ transplants, radiation treatment, certain drug therapies, recreational drug use, exposure to heavy metals, bites from certain species of venomous snakes, pesticides,[2][3] certain industrial cleaning solvents,[4] fuels[5] and certain naturally occurring substances.  Symptoms may appear immediately after exposure or be delayed. They may include limb weakness or numbness, loss of memory, vision, and/or intellect, uncontrollable obsessive and/or compulsive behaviors, delusions, headache, cognitive and behavioral problems and sexual dysfunction. Chronic mold exposure in homes can lead to neurotoxicity which may not appear for months to years of exposure.[6] All symptoms listed above are consistent with mold mycotoxin accumulation.[7]

Osteopetrosis renal tubular acidosis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteopetrosis_renal_tubular_acidosis,O,"Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a medical condition that involves an accumulation of acid in the body due to a failure of the kidneys to appropriately acidify the urine.[1] In renal physiology, when blood is filtered by the kidney, the filtrate passes through the tubules of the nephron, allowing for exchange of salts, acid equivalents, and other solutes before it drains into the bladder as urine. The metabolic acidosis that results from RTA may be caused either by insufficient secretion of hydrogen ions (which are acidic) into the latter portions of the nephron (the distal tubule) or by failure to reabsorb sufficient bicarbonate ions (which are alkaline) from the filtrate in the early portion of the nephron (the proximal tubule). Although a metabolic acidosis also occurs in those with chronic kidney disease, the term RTA is reserved for individuals with poor urinary acidification in otherwise well-functioning kidneys. Several different types of RTA exist, which all have different syndromes and different causes. RTA is usually an incidental finding based on routine blood draws that show abnormal results. Clinically, patients may present with vague symptoms such as dehydration, mental status changes, or delayed growth in adolescents.[2]

The metabolic acidosis that results from RTA may be caused either by insufficient secretion of hydrogen ions (which are acidic) into the latter portions of the nephron (the distal tubule) or by failure to reabsorb sufficient bicarbonate ions (which are alkaline) from the filtrate in the early portion of the nephron (the proximal tubule). Although a metabolic acidosis also occurs in those with chronic kidney disease, the term RTA is reserved for individuals with poor urinary acidification in otherwise well-functioning kidneys. Several different types of RTA exist, which all have different syndromes and different causes. RTA is usually an incidental finding based on routine blood draws that show abnormal results.

These names are older and nearly obsolete general terms from psychiatry, referring to many physical disorders that cause impaired mental function.[2] They are meant to exclude psychiatric disorders (mental disorders). Originally, the term was created to distinguish physical (termed ""organic"") causes of mental impairment from psychiatric (termed ""functional"") disorders, but during the era when this distinction was drawn, not enough was known about brain science (including neuroscience, cognitive science, neuropsychology, and mind-brain correlation) for this cause-based classification to be more than educated guesswork labeled with misplaced certainty, which is why it has been deemphasized in current medicine. While mental or behavioural abnormalities related to the dysfunction can be permanent,[3] treating the disease early may prevent permanent damage in addition to fully restoring mental functions. An organic cause to brain dysfunction is suspected when there is no indication of a clearly defined psychiatric or ""inorganic"" cause, such as a mood disorder.[4]

It is the result of a mutation in the GBE1 gene, which causes a defect in the glycogen branching enzyme. Therefore, glycogen is not made properly, and abnormal glycogen molecules accumulate in cells; most severely in cardiac and muscle cells. The severity of this disease varies on the amount of enzyme produced. GSD IV is autosomal recessive, which means each parent has a mutant copy of the gene but shows no symptoms of the disease. Having an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, males and females are equally likely to be affected by Andersen's disease. Classic Andersen's disease typically becomes apparent during the first few months after the patient is born. Approximately 1 in 20,000 to 25,000 newborns have a glycogen storage disease.[4] Andersen's disease affects 1 in 800,000 individuals worldwide, with 3% of all GSDs being type IV.[5] The disease was described and studied first by Dorothy Hansine Andersen.[6][7]

This is in contrast to central or neurogenic diabetes insipidus, which is caused by insufficient levels of vasopressin (also called antidiuretic hormone, ADH). Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by an improper response of the kidney to vasopressin, leading to a decrease in the ability of the kidney to concentrate the urine by removing free water.

Derived from the Greek opsismos (""late""), the name ""opsismodysplasia"" describes a delay in bone maturation. In addition to this delay, the disorder is characterized by micromelia (short or undersized bones), particularly of the hands and feet, delay of ossification (bone cell formation), platyspondyly (flattened vertebrae), irregular metaphyses, an array of facial aberrations and respiratory distress related to chronic infection. Opsismodysplasia is congenital, being apparent at birth. It has a variable mortality, with some affected individuals living to adulthood. The disorder is rare, with an incidence of less than 1 per 1,000,000 worldwide. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means the defective (mutated) gene that causes the disorder is located on an autosome, and the disorder occurs when two copies of this defective gene are inherited. No specific gene has been found to be associated with the disorder. It is similar to spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, Sedaghatian type.[2][3][4][5][6]

Opportunistic infections,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_infection,O,"An opportunistic infection is an infection that occurs most commonly in individuals with an immunodeficiency disorder and acts more severe on those with a weakened immune system. These types of infections are considered serious and can be caused by a variety of pathogens including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites.[1] Under normal conditions, such as in humans with uncompromised immune systems, an opportunistic infection would be less likely to cause significant harm and would typically result in a mild infection or no effect at all. These opportunistic infections can stem from a variety of sources, such as a weakened immune system (caused by human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), when being treated with immunosuppressive drugs (as in cancer treatment),[2] when a microbiome is altered (such as a disruption in gut microbiota), or when integumentary barriers are breached (as in penetrating trauma). Opportunistic infections can contribute to antimicrobial resistance in an individual making these infections more severe. Some pathogens that cause these infections possess intrinsic resistance (natural resistance) to many antibiotics while others acquire resistance over time through mutations or horizontal gene transfer.[3] Many of these pathogens, such as the bacterium Clostridioides difficile (C. diff), can be present in hosts with uncompromised immune systems without generating any symptoms, and can, in some cases, act as commensals until the balance of the immune system is disrupted.[4][5][6][7] With C. diff and many other pathogens, the overuse or misuse of antibiotics can cause the disruption of normal microbiota and lead to an opportunistic infection caused by antibiotic resistant pathogens.[8]  In some cases, opportunistic infections can be labeled as a hospital-acquired infection due to individuals contracting them within a healthcare/hospital setting.[9] In terms of history, there is not one individual that can be attributed for discovering opportunistic infections. Over time and through medical advancement, there have been many scientists that have contributed to the study and treatment options for patients affected by these infections.[10][11]

Over time, individuals taking opioids can also develop an increasing sensitivity to noxious stimuli, even evolving a painful response to previously non-noxious stimuli (allodynia).[6]  This means that if the person originally felt pain from twisting or from sitting too long, the person might now additionally experience pain from a light touch or from raindrops falling on the skin.

This is thought to be caused by a blockage in the enzyme thiamine-diphosphate kinase, and therefore treatment in some patients would be to take thiamine triphosphate daily.[3][4] While the majority of patients typically exhibit symptoms between the ages of 3 and 12 months, instances of adult onset have also been documented.[5]

These symptoms are typically first visible during early childhood with the mean age of diagnosis being 13 years of age.[2] Many patients with Ollier disease are prone to develop other malignancies including bone sarcomas that necessitate treatment and the removal of malignant bone neoplasm. Cases in patients with Ollier disease has shown a link to IDH1, IDH2, and PTH1R gene mutations. Currently, there are no forms of treatment for the underlying condition of Ollier disease but complications such as fractures, deformities, malignancies that arise from it can be treated through surgical procedures. The prevalence of this condition is estimated at around 1 in 100,000.[3] It is unclear whether the men or women are more affected by this disorder due to conflicting case studies.

Pigment dispersion syndrome,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment_dispersion_syndrome,P,"Pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) is an  eye disorder that can lead to a form of glaucoma known as pigmentary glaucoma. It takes place when pigment cells slough off from the back of the iris and float around in the aqueous humor. Over time, these pigment cells can accumulate in the anterior chamber in such a way that they begin to clog the trabecular meshwork (the major site of aqueous humour drainage), which can in turn prevent the aqueous humour from draining and therefore increases the pressure inside the eye.[1] A common finding in PDS are central, vertical corneal endothelial pigment deposits, known as Krukenberg spindle.[2] With PDS, the intraocular pressure tends to spike at times and then can return to normal. Exercise has been shown to contribute to spikes in pressure as well. When the pressure is great enough to cause damage to the optic nerve, this is called pigmentary glaucoma.[1] As with all types of glaucoma, when damage happens to the optic nerve fibers, the vision loss that occurs is irreversible and painless.

Phenol sulfotransferase deficiency,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenol_sulfotransferase_deficiency,P,"Phenol sulfur transferase deficiency, in short PST deficiency, is the lack or the reduced activity of the functional enzyme phenol sulfur transferase, which is crucial in the detoxification of mainly phenolic compounds by catalysing the sulfate conjugation of the hydroxyl groups in the toxic phenolic compounds to result in more hydrophilic forms for more efficient excretion. This metabolic disorder was first discovered in the late 1990s by Dr. Rosemary Waring during her researches with autistic children, which also made this deficiency commonly associated to the topics of autism. Mutations in the PST genes account for the genetic causes of the deficiency, of which single nucleotide polymorphism and methylation of promoters are two examples of mutations that respectively cause conformational abnormalities and diminished expressions to the enzyme, resulting in the reduced detoxification of phenolic compounds and regulation of phenolic neurotransmitter. The deficiency may cause symptoms like flushing, tachycardia, and depression, and be a risk factor for disorders like autism, migraine, and cancer, while it also limits the use of phenolic drugs in PST deficient patients. There is currently no drug available for treating PST deficiency. However, some people suffering from PST deficiency have found taking a digestive enzyme supplement containing Xylanase 10 minutes before eating to greatly reduce symptoms.

Parenchymatous cortical degeneration of cerebellum,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchymatous_cortical_degeneration_of_cerebellum,P,"Cerebellar degeneration is a condition in which cerebellar cells, otherwise known as neurons, become damaged and progressively weaken in the cerebellum.[1] There are two types of cerebellar degeneration; paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, and alcoholic or nutritional cerebellar degeneration.[2] As the cerebellum contributes to the coordination and regulation of motor activities, as well as controlling equilibrium of the human body, any degeneration to this part of the organ can be life-threatening. Cerebellar degeneration can result in disorders in fine movement, posture, and motor learning in humans, due to a disturbance of the vestibular system. This condition may not only cause cerebellar damage on a temporary or permanent basis, but can also affect other tissues of the central nervous system, those including the cerebral cortex, spinal cord and the brainstem (made up of the medulla oblongata, midbrain, and pons).[2]

PKS is due to the presence of an extra and abnormal chromosome termed a small supernumerary marker chromosome (sSMC). sSMCs contain copies of genetic material from parts of virtually any other chromosome and, depending on the genetic material they carry, can cause various genetic disorders and neoplasms. The sSMC in PKS consists of multiple copies of the short (i.e. ""p"") arm of chromosome 12.[1] Consequently, the multiple copies of the genetic material in the sSMC plus the two copies of this genetic material in the two normal chromosome 12's are overexpressed and thereby cause the syndrome.[2] Due to a form of genetic mosaicism, however, individuals with PKS differ in the tissue distributions of their sSMC and therefore show different syndrome-related birth defects and disease severities. For example, individuals with the sSMC in their heart tissue are likely to have cardiac structural abnormalities while those without this sSMC localization have a structurally normal heart.[3]

Systemic carnitine deficiency,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_carnitine_deficiency,S,"Systemic primary carnitine deficiency (SPCD)[1]  is an inborn error of fatty acid transport caused by a defect in the transporter responsible for moving carnitine across the plasma membrane. Carnitine is an important amino acid for fatty acid metabolism.[4] When carnitine cannot be transported into tissues, fatty acid oxidation is impaired, leading to a variety of symptoms such as chronic muscle weakness, cardiomyopathy, hypoglycemia and liver dysfunction.  The specific transporter involved with SPCD is OCTN2, coded for by the SLC22A5 gene located on chromosome 5.  SPCD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, with mutated alleles coming from both parents.

Amniotic band syndrome,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amniotic_band_syndrome,S,"Constriction ring syndrome (CRS) is a congenital disorder with unknown cause. Because of the unknown cause there are many different, and sometimes incorrect, names. It is a malformation due to intrauterine bands or rings that produce deep grooves in (most commonly distal) extremities such as fingers and toes. In rare cases the constriction ring can form around other parts of the fetus and cause amputation or even intrauterine death. The anatomy proximal to the site of constriction (or amputation) is developmentally normal.[2][3][4]
CRS can be associated with other malformations, with club foot being most common.[5][6][7]
The precise configuration of the bands, lymphedema, and character of the amputations are not predictable and vary with each individual patient. Also, more than one extremity is usually affected, and it is rare for only one ring to present as an isolated malformation with no other manifestation of this syndrome.[2][3][8][9]

The symptoms are a result of dysfunction of  long axons in the spinal cord. The affected cells are the primary motor neurons; therefore, the disease is an upper motor neuron disease.[2] HSP is not a form of cerebral palsy even though it physically may appear and behave much the same as spastic diplegia. The origin of HSP  is different from cerebral palsy. Despite this, some of the same anti-spasticity medications used in spastic cerebral palsy are sometimes used to  treat HSP symptoms.

Splenomegaly,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splenomegaly,S,"Splenomegaly is an enlargement of the spleen.[1] The spleen usually lies in the left upper quadrant (LUQ) of the human abdomen. Splenomegaly is one of the four cardinal signs of hypersplenism which include: some reduction in number of circulating blood cells affecting granulocytes, erythrocytes or platelets in any combination; a compensatory proliferative response in the bone marrow; and the potential for correction of these abnormalities by splenectomy. Splenomegaly is usually associated with increased workload (such as in hemolytic anemias), which suggests that it is a response to hyperfunction. It is therefore not surprising that splenomegaly is associated with any disease process that involves abnormal red blood cells being destroyed in the spleen. Other common causes include congestion due to portal hypertension and infiltration by leukemias and lymphomas. Thus, the finding of an enlarged spleen, along with caput medusae, is an important sign of portal hypertension.[2]

Müllerian agenesis (including absence of the uterus, cervix and/or vagina) is the cause in 15% of cases of primary amenorrhoea.[2] Because most of the vagina does not develop from the Müllerian duct, instead developing from the urogenital sinus, along with the bladder and urethra, it is present even when the Müllerian duct is completely absent. Because ovaries do not develop from the Müllerian ducts, affected people might have normal secondary sexual characteristics but are infertile due to the lack of a functional uterus. However, biological motherhood is possible through uterus transplantation or use of gestational surrogates.

Right atrium familial dilatation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_atrium_familial_dilatation,R,"Right atrial enlargement (RAE) is a form of cardiomegaly, or heart enlargement. It can broadly be classified as either right atrial hypertrophy (RAH), overgrowth, or dilation, like an expanding balloon. Common causes include pulmonary hypertension, which can be the primary defect leading to RAE, or pulmonary hypertension secondary to tricuspid stenosis; pulmonary stenosis or Tetralogy of Fallot i.e. congenital diseases; chronic lung disease, such as cor pulmonale. Other recognised causes are: right ventricular failure, tricuspid regurgitation, and atrial septal defect.[1] Right atrial enlargement (RAE) is clinically significant due to its prevalence in diagnosing supraventricular arrhythmias. Further, early diagnosis using risk factors like RAE may decrease mortality because patients with RAE are at 9x more risk of arrhythmias and other cardiac conditions compared to their healthy counterparts.[2] Treatment for RAE can include taking certain medications such as diuretics, beta-blockers, anticoagulants, and anti-arrhythmics.  If medications are not effective enough, procedures such as implanting a pacemaker, cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), or a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), heart valve surgery, and coronary bypass surgery may be needed.[3] The last resort treatment option would be a complete heart transplant. Prevention for RAE comes from maintaining a healthy lifestyle with plenty of exercise and eating plenty of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains and avoiding or limiting alcohol and caffeine.[4] It is also important to control heart disease risk factors including diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. Exercise, pregnancy, and prior health conditions like ASD II can also promote cardiac remodeling, so routine primary care visits are important to distinguish between physiological and pathological atrial enlargement.[5][6] Regular primary care visits and routine testing has also been shown to protect against the development of cardiovascular disease and may play a key role in early identification and treatment.[7]

Spinal shock,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_shock,S,"Spinal shock was first explored by Robert Whytt in 1750 as a loss of sensation accompanied by motor paralysis with initial loss but gradual recovery of reflexes, following a spinal cord injury (SCI) – most often a complete transection. Reflexes in the spinal cord below the level of injury are depressed (hyporeflexia) or absent (areflexia), while those above the level of the injury remain unaffected. The 'shock' in spinal shock does not refer to circulatory collapse, and should not be confused with neurogenic shock, which is life-threatening. The term ""spinal shock"" was introduced more than 150 years ago in an attempt to distinguish arterial hypotension due to a hemorrhagic source from arterial hypotension due to loss of sympathetic tone resulting from spinal cord injury.

"
Renal tubular acidosis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_tubular_acidosis,R,"Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a medical condition that involves an accumulation of acid in the body due to a failure of the kidneys to appropriately acidify the urine.[1] In renal physiology, when blood is filtered by the kidney, the filtrate passes through the tubules of the nephron, allowing for exchange of salts, acid equivalents, and other solutes before it drains into the bladder as urine. The metabolic acidosis that results from RTA may be caused either by insufficient secretion of hydrogen ions (which are acidic) into the latter portions of the nephron (the distal tubule) or by failure to reabsorb sufficient bicarbonate ions (which are alkaline) from the filtrate in the early portion of the nephron (the proximal tubule). Although a metabolic acidosis also occurs in those with chronic kidney disease, the term RTA is reserved for individuals with poor urinary acidification in otherwise well-functioning kidneys. Several different types of RTA exist, which all have different syndromes and different causes. RTA is usually an incidental finding based on routine blood draws that show abnormal results. Clinically, patients may present with vague symptoms such as dehydration, mental status changes, or delayed growth in adolescents.[2]

Müllerian agenesis (including absence of the uterus, cervix and/or vagina) is the cause in 15% of cases of primary amenorrhoea.[2] Because most of the vagina does not develop from the Müllerian duct, instead developing from the urogenital sinus, along with the bladder and urethra, it is present even when the Müllerian duct is completely absent. Because ovaries do not develop from the Müllerian ducts, affected people might have normal secondary sexual characteristics but are infertile due to the lack of a functional uterus. However, biological motherhood is possible through uterus transplantation or use of gestational surrogates.

Sixth nerve palsy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_nerve_palsy,S,"Sixth nerve palsy, or abducens nerve palsy, is a disorder associated with dysfunction of cranial nerve VI (the abducens nerve), which is responsible for causing contraction of the lateral rectus muscle to abduct (i.e., turn out) the eye.[1] The inability of an eye to turn outward, results in a convergent strabismus or esotropia of which the primary symptom is diplopia (commonly known as double vision) in which the two images appear side-by-side. Thus, the diplopia is horizontal and worse in the  distance. Diplopia is also increased on looking to the affected side and is partly caused by overaction of the medial rectus on the unaffected side as it tries to provide the extra innervation to the affected lateral rectus. These two muscles are synergists or ""yoke muscles"" as both attempt to move the eye over to the left or right. The condition is commonly unilateral but can also occur bilaterally.[2]

Symptoms may also include, but are not limited to, coughing, shortness of breath, excess mucus in the bronchial tube, swollen mucous membrane in the bronchial tube, and/or hypersensitive bronchial tubes.[medical citation needed] Physicians most commonly label patients with RAD when they are hesitant about formally diagnosing a patient with asthma, which is most prevalent in the pediatric setting. While some physicians may use RAD and asthma synonymously, there is controversy over this usage.

"Shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxic_shellfish_poisoning,S,"Neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP) is caused by the consumption of brevetoxins, which are marine toxins produced by the dinoflagellate Karenia brevis (among several others). These toxins can produce a series of gastrointestinal and neurological effects. Outbreaks of NSP commonly take place following harmful algal bloom (HAB) events, commonly referred to as ""Florida red tide"" (given that blooms are more commonplace along the coasts of Florida and Texas, especially during late summer and early fall). Algal blooms are a naturally-occurring phenomenon, however their frequency has been increasing in recent decades at least in-part due to human activities, climate changes, and the eutrophication (over-abundance of plant nutrients as a result of agricultural runoff, deforestation, river bed erosion, etc.) of marine waters.[1][2][3][4] HABs have been occurring for all of documented history, evidenced by the Native Americans' understanding of the dangers of shellfish consumption during periods of marine bioluminescence (a phenomenon observed during algal blooms).[5] Blooms have been noted to occur as far north as North Carolina and are commonly seen alongside the widespread death of fish and sea birds.[4] In addition to the effects on human health, the economic impact of HAB-associated shellfish toxin outbreaks can have significant economic implications as well due to not only the associated healthcare costs, but the adverse impact on the commercial shellfish industry.[3]

The most widely accepted model posits that the incidence of cancers due to ionizing radiation increases linearly with effective radiation dose at a rate of 5.5% per sievert;[1] if  correct, natural background radiation is the most hazardous source of radiation to general public health, followed by medical imaging as a close second.[citation needed] Additionally, the vast majority of non-invasive cancers are non-melanoma skin cancers caused by ultraviolet radiation (which lies on the boundary between ionizing and non-ionizing radiation).

Sheehan syndrome,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheehan_syndrome,S,"Sheehan's syndrome, also known as postpartum pituitary gland necrosis, occurs when the pituitary gland is damaged due to significant blood loss and hypovolemic shock (ischemic necrosis) or stroke, originally described during or after childbirth leading to decreased functioning of the pituitary gland (hypopituitarism).[1] Classically, in the milder partial form, the mother is unable to breastfeed her baby, due to failure of the pituitary to secrete the hormone prolactin, and also has no more periods, because FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) and LH (Luteinising Hormone) are not secreted. Although postmenopausal, the mother with this milder form of Sheehan's syndrome does not experience hot flushes, because the pituitary fails to secrete FSH (high levels of FSH, secreted by the pituitary in healthy postmenopausal women is an attempt to trigger ovulation, and these high levels of FSH cause hot the flushes). The failure to breastfeed and amenorrhea no more periods, were seen as the syndrome (a collection of symptoms), but we now view Sheehan's as the pituitary failing to secrete 1-5 of the 9 hormones that it normally produces (the anterior (front) lobe of the pituitary produces FSH, LH, prolactin, ACTH (Adreno-cortico-trophic hormone),TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) and GH (Growth Hormone); the posterior (the lobe at the back) pituitary produces ADH (Anti-Diuretic Hormone) and Oxytocin, i.e. the pituitary is involved in the regulation of many hormones. It is very important to recognise Sheehan' stroke as, the ACTH deficiency Sheehan's in the presence of the stress of a bacterial infection, such as a urine infection, will result in death of the mother from Addisonian crisis.[2][3] This gland is located on the under-surface of the brain, the shape of a cherry and the size of a chickpea and sits in a pit or depression of the sphenoid bone known as the sella turcica (the Turk's saddle).[4] The pituitary gland works in conjunction with the hypothalamus, and other endocrine organs to modulate numerous bodily functions including growth, metabolism, menstruation, lactation, and even the ""fight-or-flight"" response.[3] These endocrine organs, (like the thyroid gland in the neck, or adrenals on the upper pole of the kidneys), release hormones in very specific pathways, known as hormonal axes. For example, the release of a hormone in the hypothalamus will target the pituitary to trigger the release thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and the pituitary's released hormone (TSH) will target the next organ in the pathway i.e. the thyroid to release thyroxin.[3] Hence, damage to the pituitary gland can have downstream effects on any of the aforementioned bodily functions.

It may occur as a single event or subsequent bouts may cause further spread. It is most common in males.[2]: 829  It is named after Jay Frank Schamberg, who described it in 1901. There is no known cure for this disease but it is not a life-threatening condition and is mainly of cosmetic concern, although, because it can appear so suddenly, so extensively and because it usually leaves permanent discoloration of the skin, it can cause understandable psychological concern. The skin lesions sometimes cause itching, which can be treated by applying cortisone cream.  The cortisone cream will only help with the itching and does not improve the discoloration of the skin. Schamberg's disease causes no other symptoms beside skin discoloration and itching. The condition is caused by inflammation of capillaries near the surface of skin and subsequent leaking of red blood cells into surrounding tissues. As the red blood cells break down and get mostly resorbed, some of the iron released by the red blood cells remains in the skin and causes the characteristic rust-colored appearance. The cause of the capillary inflammation is usually unknown.

This is a problem as treatment and prognosis differ greatly for most of these diagnoses. Many people with schizoaffective disorder have other mental disorders including anxiety disorders.[5][7]

It may occur as a single event or subsequent bouts may cause further spread. It is most common in males.[2]: 829  It is named after Jay Frank Schamberg, who described it in 1901. There is no known cure for this disease but it is not a life-threatening condition and is mainly of cosmetic concern, although, because it can appear so suddenly, so extensively and because it usually leaves permanent discoloration of the skin, it can cause understandable psychological concern. The skin lesions sometimes cause itching, which can be treated by applying cortisone cream.  The cortisone cream will only help with the itching and does not improve the discoloration of the skin. Schamberg's disease causes no other symptoms beside skin discoloration and itching. The condition is caused by inflammation of capillaries near the surface of skin and subsequent leaking of red blood cells into surrounding tissues. As the red blood cells break down and get mostly resorbed, some of the iron released by the red blood cells remains in the skin and causes the characteristic rust-colored appearance. The cause of the capillary inflammation is usually unknown.

Schindler disease,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schindler_disease,S,"Schindler disease, also known as Kanzaki disease and alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency, is a rare disease found in humans. This lysosomal storage disorder is caused by  a deficiency in the enzyme alpha-NAGA (alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase), attributable to mutations in the NAGA gene on chromosome 22,[1][2] which leads to excessive lysosomal accumulation of glycoproteins.[3] A deficiency of the alpha-NAGA enzyme leads to an accumulation of glycosphingolipids throughout the body. This accumulation of sugars gives rise to the clinical features associated with this disorder.  Schindler disease is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that one must inherit an abnormal allele from both parents in order to have the disease.

There are also about 800–1,000 minor salivary glands in the mucosa of the mouth. The parotid glands are in front of the ears, one on side, and secrete mostly serous saliva, via the parotid ducts (Stenson ducts), into the mouth, usually opening roughly opposite the second upper molars. The submandibular gland is medial to the angle of the mandible, and it drains its mixture of serous and mucous saliva via the submandibular duct (Wharton duct) into the mouth, usually opening in a punctum in the floor of mouth. The sublingual gland is below the tongue, on the floor of the mouth; it drains its mostly mucous saliva into the mouth via about 8–20 ducts, which open along the plica sublingualis, a fold of tissue under the tongue.[2]

Most species whose cells have nuclei (eukaryotes) are diploid, meaning they have two complete sets of chromosomes, one from each of two parents; each set contains the same number of chromosomes, and the chromosomes are joined in pairs of homologous chromosomes. However, some organisms are polyploid. Polyploidy is especially common in plants. Most eukaryotes have diploid somatic cells, but produce haploid gametes (eggs and sperm) by meiosis. A monoploid has only one set of chromosomes, and the term is usually only applied to cells or organisms that are normally diploid. Males of bees and other Hymenoptera, for example, are monoploid. Unlike animals, plants and multicellular algae have life cycles with two alternating multicellular generations. The gametophyte generation is haploid, and produces gametes by mitosis; the sporophyte generation is diploid and produces spores by meiosis.

This disease is present at birth. TDO has been shown to occur in areas of close geographic proximity and within families; most recent documented cases are in Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina. The cause of this disease is a mutation in the DLX3 (distal-less 3) gene, which controls hair follicle differentiation and induction of bone formation. All patients with TDO have two co-existing conditions called enamel hypoplasia and taurodontism in which the abnormal growth patterns of the teeth result in severe external and internal defects.[1] The hair defects are characterized as being rough, course, with profuse shedding. Hair is curly and kinky at infancy but later straightens. Dental defects are characterized by dark-yellow/brownish colored teeth, thin and/or possibly pitted enamel, that is malformed. The teeth can also look normal in color, but also have a physical impression of extreme fragility and thinness in appearance. Additionally, severe underbites where the top and bottom teeth fail to correctly align may be present; it is common for the affected individual to have a larger, more pronounced lower jaw and longer bones. The physical deformities that TDO causes become more noticeable with age, and emotional support for the family as well as the affected individual is frequently recommended. Adequate treatment for TDO is a team based approach, mostly involving physical therapists, dentists, and oromaxillofacial surgeons. Genetic counseling is also recommended.

However, some organisms are polyploid. Polyploidy is especially common in plants. Most eukaryotes have diploid somatic cells, but produce haploid gametes (eggs and sperm) by meiosis. A monoploid has only one set of chromosomes, and the term is usually only applied to cells or organisms that are normally diploid. Males of bees and other Hymenoptera, for example, are monoploid. Unlike animals, plants and multicellular algae have life cycles with two alternating multicellular generations. The gametophyte generation is haploid, and produces gametes by mitosis; the sporophyte generation is diploid and produces spores by meiosis.

All forms involve the pulling of the spinal cord at the base of the spinal canal, literally a tethered cord.[1] The spinal cord normally hangs loose in the canal, free to move up and down with growth, and with bending and stretching. A tethered cord, however, is held taut at the end or at some point in the spinal canal. In children, a tethered cord can force the spinal cord to stretch as they grow. In adults the spinal cord stretches in the course of normal activity, usually leading to progressive spinal cord damage if untreated.[1] TCS is often associated with the closure of a spina bifida. It can be congenital, such as in tight filum terminale, or the result of injury later in life.[2][3]

Williams syndrome,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_syndrome,List of neurological conditions and disorders,"Williams syndrome (WS), also Williams–Beuren syndrome (WBS), is a genetic disorder that affects many parts of the body.[2] Facial features frequently include a broad forehead, underdeveloped chin, short nose, and full cheeks.[2] Mild to moderate intellectual disability is observed, particularly challenges with visual spatial tasks such as drawing. Verbal skills are relatively unaffected.[2] Many people have an outgoing personality, a happy disposition, an openness to engaging with other people, increased empathy and decreased aggression.[2][4] Medical issues with teeth, heart problems (especially supravalvular aortic stenosis), and periods of high blood calcium are common.[1][2]

Expressive aphasia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressive_aphasia,List of communication disorders,"Expressive aphasia (also known as Broca's aphasia) is a type of aphasia characterized by partial loss of the ability to produce language (spoken, manual,[1] or written), although comprehension generally remains intact.[2] A person with expressive aphasia will exhibit effortful speech. Speech generally includes important content words but leaves out function words that have more grammatical significance than physical meaning, such as prepositions and articles.[3] This is known as ""telegraphic speech"". The person's intended message may still be understood, but their sentence will not be grammatically correct. In very severe forms of expressive aphasia, a person may only speak using single word utterances.[4][5] Typically, comprehension is mildly to moderately impaired in expressive aphasia due to difficulty understanding complex grammar.[4][5]

A prototype is generally used to evaluate a new design to enhance precision by system analysts and users.[2][3] Prototyping serves to provide specifications for a real, working system rather than a theoretical one.[4] Physical prototyping has a long history, and paper prototyping and virtual prototyping now extensively complement it. In some design workflow models, creating a prototype (a process sometimes called materialization) is the step between the formalization and the evaluation of an idea.[5]
"
Dimensional,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_models_of_personality_disorders,List of personality disorders,"In personality pathology, dimensional models of personality disorders (also known as the dimensional approach to personality disorders, dimensional classification, and dimensional assessments) conceptualize personality disorders as qualitatively rather than quantitatively different from normal personality. They consist of extreme, maladaptive levels of certain personality characteristics (these characteristics are commonly described as facets within broader personality factors or traits). Within the context of personality psychology, a ""dimension"" refers to a continuum on which an individual can have various levels of a characteristic, in contrast to the dichotomous categorical approach in which an individual does or does not possess a characteristic. According to dimensional models personality disorders are classified according to which characteristics are expressed at which levels. This stands in contrast to the traditional categorical models of classification, which are based on the boolean presence or absence of symptoms and do not take into account levels of expression of a characteristic or the presence of any underlying dimension.[citation needed]

Atmospheric dispersion modeling,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_dispersion_modeling,List of pollution-related diseases,"Atmospheric dispersion modeling is the mathematical simulation of how air pollutants disperse in the ambient atmosphere. It is performed with computer programs that include algorithms to solve the mathematical equations that govern the pollutant dispersion. The dispersion models are used to estimate the downwind ambient concentration of air pollutants or toxins emitted from sources such as industrial plants, vehicular traffic or accidental chemical releases. They can also be used to predict future concentrations under specific scenarios (i.e. changes in emission sources). Therefore, they are the dominant type of model used in air quality policy making. They are most useful for pollutants that are dispersed over large distances and that may react in the atmosphere. For pollutants that have a very high spatio-temporal variability (i.e. have very steep distance to source decay such as black carbon) and for epidemiological studies statistical land-use regression models are also used.

Medical history,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_history,List of infectious diseases,"The medical history, case history, or anamnesis (from Greek: ἀνά, aná, ""open"", and μνήσις, mnesis, ""memory"") of a patient is a set of information the physicians collect over medical interviews. It involves the patient, and eventually people close to them, so to collect reliable/objective information for managing the medical diagnosis and proposing efficient medical treatments. The medically relevant complaints reported by the patient or others familiar with the patient are referred to as symptoms, in contrast with clinical signs, which are ascertained by direct examination on the part of medical personnel. Most health encounters will result in some form of history being taken. Medical histories vary in their depth and focus. For example, an ambulance paramedic would typically limit their history to important details, such as name, history of presenting complaint, allergies, etc. In contrast, a psychiatric history is frequently lengthy and in depth, as many details about the patient's life are relevant to formulating a management plan for a psychiatric illness.

t,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:Arthropod-borne_diseases_and_infestations,List of infectious diseases,"This template appears to mostly be about arthropod infestations, i.e. the arthropod is present, causing disease. Although the name is ""Arthropod infestations"" the title is ""Diseases from arthropods and ectoparasitics [sic]"" which is a little more ambiguous I think. This could include diseases where the arthropod is simply a vector and the disease persists even when the arthropod is gone. This is the case for most of the mosquito-borne diseases which are linked. Should we remove that link? Or do we truly want this to include all diseases, in which case we would need to make a lot of additions, for example diseases where sandflies, tsetse flies, kissing bugs, ticks, mites, etc are the vector. There is already a separate template for diseases transmitted by ticks and mites, Template:Acari-borne diseases. I am considering making a new template for diseases where insects are the vector, in the same style as the Acari one. Mthoma15 (talk) 03:48, 1 September 2019 (UTC)[reply]

Cases of algaemia have been observed in dogs and cats as well.[2] Few cases have been observed in humans. Human cases of protothecosis are examined on a case-by-case basis due to the particularity of each case.

Long regarded as being caused by a fungus, the causative agent was not discovered until 1987. It occurs most commonly in horses, dogs, and humans, with isolated cases in other large mammals.[1]  The disease is contracted after exposure to stagnant fresh water such as swamps, ponds, lakes, and rice paddies. P. insidiosum is different from other members of the genus in that human and horse hair, skin, and decaying animal and plant tissue are chemoattractants for its zoospores.[2] Additionally, it is the only member in the genus known to infect mammals, while other members are pathogenic to plants and are responsible for some well-known plant diseases.

Loa loa,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loa_loa_filariasis,List of infectious diseases,"Loa loa filariasis,  (Loiasis) is a skin and eye disease caused by the nematode worm Loa loa. Humans contract this disease through the bite of a deer fly (Chrysops spp.) or mango fly, the vectors for Loa loa. The adult Loa loa filarial worm can reach from three to seven centimetres long and migrates throughout the subcutaneous tissues of humans, occasionally crossing into subconjunctival tissues of the eye where it can be easily observed.[2] Loa loa does not normally affect vision but can be painful when moving about the eyeball or across the bridge of the nose.[3][4] Loiasis can cause red itchy swellings below the skin called ""Calabar swellings"". The disease is treated with the drug diethylcarbamazine (DEC), and when appropriate, surgical methods may be employed to remove adult worms from the conjunctiva. Loiasis belongs to the group of neglected tropical diseases, and there is a call for it to be included in the high-priority listing.[2]

Pro-ana groups differ widely in their stances. Most claim that they exist mainly as a non-judgmental environment for anorexics; a place to turn to, to discuss their illness, and to support those who choose to enter recovery. Others deny anorexia nervosa is a mental illness and claim instead that it is a lifestyle choice that should be respected by doctors and family.[1]

Mobile phones and driving safety,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phones_and_driving_safety,List of eating disorders,"Mobile phone use while driving is common but it is dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and subsequent crashes. Due to the number of crashes that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal in an attempt to curb the practice, with varying levels of efficacy. Many jurisdictions have enacted laws making handheld mobile phone use illegal. Many jurisdictions allow use of a hands-free device. Driving while using a hands-free device has been found by some studies to provide little to no benefit versus holding the device itself and carrying on a conversation.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7] In some cases restrictions are directed only at minors, those who are newly qualified license holders (particularly those of a younger age), or to drivers in school zones. In addition to voice calling, activities such as texting while driving, web browsing, playing video games, or phone use in general may also increase the risk of a crash.

Evolutionary,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychiatry,List of eating disorders,"Evolutionary psychiatry, also known as Darwinian Psychiatry,[1][2] is a theoretical approach to psychiatry that aims to explain psychiatric disorders in evolutionary terms.[3][4] As a branch of the field of evolutionary medicine, it is distinct from the medical practice of psychiatry in its emphasis on providing scientific explanations rather than treatments for mental disorder. This often concerns questions of ultimate causation. For example, psychiatric genetics may discover genes associated with mental disorders, but evolutionary psychiatry asks why those genes persist in the population. Other core questions in evolutionary psychiatry are why heritable mental disorders are so common[5] how to distinguish mental function and dysfunction,[6] and whether certain forms of suffering conveyed an adaptive advantage.[7] Disorders commonly considered are depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, autism, eating disorders, and others. Key explanatory concepts are of evolutionary mismatch (when modern environments cause mental health conditions) and the fact that evolution is guided by reproductive success rather than health or wellbeing. Rather than providing an alternative account of the cause of mental disorder, evolutionary psychiatry seeks to integrate findings from traditional schools of psychology and psychiatry such as social psychology, behaviourism, biological psychiatry and psychoanalysis into a holistic account related to evolutionary biology. In this sense, it aims to meet the criteria of a Kuhnian paradigm shift.

Mycoplasma hominis infection,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma_hominis_infection,List of infectious diseases,"The exact role of Mycoplasma hominis (and to a lesser extent Ureaplasma) regarding some conditions related to pregnant women and their (unborn) offspring is controversial. This is mainly because many healthy adults have genitourinary colonization with Mycoplasma, published studies on pathogenicity have important design limitations, and the organisms are challenging to detect.[1] The likelihood of colonization with M. hominis appears directly linked to the number of lifetime sexual partners[2]
Neonatal colonization does occur, but only through normal vaginal delivery. Caesarean section appears protective against colonization and is much less common. Neonatal colonization is transient.[3]

Embryogenesis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryogenesis,List of vulvovaginal disorders,"An embryo is the initial stage of development for a multicellular organism. In organisms that reproduce sexually, embryonic development is the part of the life cycle that begins just after fertilization of the female egg cell by the male sperm cell. The resulting fusion of these two cells produces a single-celled zygote that undergoes many cell divisions that produce cells known as blastomeres. The blastomeres (4-cell stage) are arranged as a solid ball that when reaching a certain size, called a morula, (16-cell stage) takes in fluid to create a cavity called a blastocoel. The structure is then termed a blastula, or a blastocyst in mammals.

In the human fetus, the genital tubercle develops around week four of gestation, and by week nine, becomes recognizably either a clitoris or penis. This should not be confused with the sinus tubercle which is a proliferation of endoderm induced by paramesonephric ducts. Even after the phallus is developed (either a penile shaft or clitoral shaft),[4] the term genital tubercle remains, but only as the terminal end of it,[5] which develops into either the glans penis or the glans clitoridis.

NL63,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_coronavirus_NL63,List of infectious diseases,"Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63, Alphacoronavirus amsterdamense)[1] is a species of coronavirus, assigned to the subgenus Setracovirus and the genus Alphacoronavirus. It was identified in late 2004 in patients in the Netherlands by Lia van der Hoek and Krzysztof Pyrc[2] using a novel virus discovery method VIDISCA.[3] Later on the discovery was confirmed by the researchers from Rotterdam.[4] The virus is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus which enters its host cell by binding to ACE2.[5][6][7] Infection with the virus has been confirmed worldwide, and has an association with many common symptoms and diseases. Associated diseases include mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections, severe lower respiratory tract infection, croup and bronchiolitis.[8][9][10]

OC43,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_coronavirus_OC43,List of infectious diseases,"Human coronavirus OC43[1] (HCoV-OC43) is a member of the species Betacoronavirus gravedinis,[2] which infects humans and cattle.[3][4] The infecting coronavirus is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that enters its host cell by binding to the N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid receptor.[5] OC43 is one of seven coronaviruses known to infect humans. It is one of the viruses responsible for the common cold[6][7] and may have been responsible for the 1889–1890 pandemic.[8] It has, like other coronaviruses from genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Embecovirus, an additional shorter spike protein called hemagglutinin-esterase (HE).[9][3] ]. Genetic and antigenic analyses reveal significant similarities between HCoV-OC43 and bovine coronavirus (BCoV), suggesting a zoonotic transmission event from cattle to humans.[10] Molecular analysis estimate that this cross-species transmission occurred sometime in the late 19th century, possibly around 1890.[10] This period aligns with the ""Russian Influenza"" pandemic that occurred form 1889 -1892. This has led some researchers to theorize that HCoV-OC43 may have been the causative agent of that pandemic, rather than the influenza virus.[11] This theory is further supported by phylogenetic studies indicating a recent common ancestor between HCoV-OC43 and BCoV around that time.[11]

Sibling estrangement,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibling_estrangement,List of eating disorders,"Sibling estrangement or sibling alienation is the breakdown of relationships between siblings resulting in a lack of communication or outright avoidance of each other. It is a phenomenon that can occur in families for various reasons such as unresolved conflicts, personality differences, distance, or life events. Similar to family estrangement, sibling estrangement is also linked to disruptive family events, such as parental divorce or the death of a family member. It includes emotional and physical distancing of siblings. It is a voluntary and intentional process in which at least one sibling creates or keeps distance from another sibling, triggered by a negative relationship between them. It can happen at different ages, in the majority of cases it happens during adulthood.[1][2]

Kernberg's object relations model of borderline personality disorder (BPD).[1] It views the individual with borderline personality organization (BPO) as holding unreconciled and contradictory internalized representations of self and significant others that are affectively charged. The defense against these contradictory internalized object relations leads to disturbed relationships with others and with oneself. The distorted perceptions of self, others, and associated affects are the focus of treatment as they emerge in the relationship with the therapist (transference). The treatment focuses on the integration of split-off parts of self and object representations, and the consistent interpretation of these distorted perceptions is considered the mechanism of change.

Mentalization-based treatment,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentalization-based_treatment,List of eating disorders,"Mentalization-based treatment (MBT) is an integrative form of psychotherapy, bringing together aspects of psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, systemic and ecological approaches. MBT was developed and manualised by Peter Fonagy and Anthony Bateman, designed for individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Some of these individuals suffer from disorganized attachment and failed to develop a robust mentalization capacity. Fonagy and Bateman define mentalization as the process by which we implicitly and explicitly interpret the actions of oneself and others as meaningful on the basis of intentional mental states. An alternative and simpler definition is ""Seeing others from the inside and ourselves from the outside."" The object of treatment is that patients with BPD increase their mentalization capacity, which should improve affect regulation, thereby reducing suicidality and self-harm, as well as strengthening interpersonal relationships. A version of MBT has also been developed for individuals with antisocial personality disorder (MBT-ASPD), delivered primarily in a group setting. Because individuals with ASPD are more likely to engage and learn from peers they perceive as similar, the focus of MBT-ASPD is on facilitating constructive group interactions that support mentalizing and behavioral change.[1]

Splitting,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_(psychology),List of eating disorders,"
Splitting, also called binary thinking, dichotomous thinking, black-and-white thinking, all-or-nothing thinking, or thinking in extremes, is the failure in a person's thinking to bring together the dichotomy of both perceived positive and negative qualities of something into a cohesive, realistic whole. It is a common defense mechanism,[1] wherein the individual tends to think in extremes (e.g., an individual's actions and motivations are all good or all bad with no middle ground). This kind of dichotomous interpretation is contrasted by an acknowledgement of certain nuances known as ""shades of gray"".[2] Splitting can include different contexts, as individuals who use this defense mechanism may ""split"" representations of their own mind, of their own personality, and of others.[3] Splitting is observed in Cluster B personality disorders such as borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder,[4][5] as well as schizophrenia and depression.[6][7] In dissociative identity disorder, the term splitting is used to refer to a split in personality alters.[8]

Idealization and devaluation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealization_and_devaluation,List of eating disorders,"Psychoanalytic theory posits that an individual unable to integrate difficult feelings mobilizes specific defenses to overcome these feelings, which the individual perceives to be unbearable. The defense that effects  (brings about) this process is called splitting. Splitting is the tendency to view events or people as either all bad or all good.[1] When viewing people as all good, the individual is said to be using the defense mechanism idealization: a mental mechanism in which the person attributes exaggeratedly positive qualities to the self or others. When viewing people as all bad, the individual employs devaluation: attributing exaggeratedly negative qualities to the self or others.[citation needed]

Cervical cerclage,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cerclage,List of vulvovaginal disorders,"Cervical cerclage, also known as a cervical stitch, is a treatment for cervical weakness, when the cervix starts to shorten and open too early during a pregnancy causing either a late miscarriage or preterm birth. In women with a prior spontaneous preterm birth and who are pregnant with one baby, and have shortening of the cervical length less than 25 mm, a cerclage prevents a preterm birth and reduces death and illness in the baby.[1]
"
Cervical screening,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_screening,List of vulvovaginal disorders,"Cervical cancer screening is a medical screening test designed to identify risk of cervical cancer. Cervical screening may involve looking for viral DNA, and/or to identify abnormal, potentially precancerous cells within the cervix as well as cells that have progressed to early stages of cervical cancer.[1][2] One goal of cervical screening is to allow for intervention and treatment so abnormal lesions can be removed prior to progression to cancer. An additional goal is to decrease mortality from cervical cancer by identifying cancerous lesions in their early stages and providing treatment prior to progression to more invasive disease.[1]
"
Impulsivity,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulsivity,List of eating disorders,"In psychology, impulsivity (or impulsiveness) is a tendency to act on a whim, displaying behavior characterized by little or no forethought, reflection, or consideration of the consequences.[1] Impulsive actions are typically ""poorly conceived, prematurely expressed, unduly risky, or inappropriate to the situation that often result in undesirable consequences,""[2] which imperil long-term goals and strategies for success.[3] Impulsivity can be classified as a multifactorial construct.[4] A functional variety of impulsivity has also been suggested, which involves action without much forethought in appropriate situations that can and does result in desirable consequences. ""When such actions have positive outcomes, they tend not to be seen as signs of impulsivity, but as indicators of boldness, quickness, spontaneity, courageousness, or unconventionality.""[2][5] Thus, the construct of impulsivity includes at least two independent components: first, acting without an appropriate amount of deliberation,[2] which may or may not be functional; and second, choosing short-term gains over long-term ones.[6]

Tubal reversal,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubal_reversal,List of vulvovaginal disorders,"Tubal reversal, also called tubal sterilization reversal, tubal ligation reversal, or microsurgical tubal reanastomosis, is a surgical procedure that can restore fertility to women after a tubal ligation. By rejoining the separated segments of the fallopian tube, tubal reversal can give women the chance to become pregnant again. In some cases, however, the separated segments cannot actually be reattached to each other. In some cases the remaining segment of tube needs to be re-implanted into the uterus (a 'tubal reimplantation'). In other cases, when the end of the tube (the 'fimbria') has been removed, a procedure called a neofimbrioplasty must be performed to recreate a functional end of the tube which can then act like the missing fimbria and retrieve the egg that has been released during ovulation.

Uterine artery embolization,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_artery_embolization,List of vulvovaginal disorders,"Uterine artery embolization (UAE, uterine fibroid embolization, or UFE) is a procedure in which an interventional radiologist uses a catheter to deliver small particles that block the blood supply to the uterine body. The procedure is primarily done for the treatment of uterine fibroids and adenomyosis.[1][2] Compared to surgical treatment for fibroids such as a hysterectomy, in which a woman's uterus is removed, uterine artery embolization may be beneficial in women who wish to retain their uterus. Other reasons for uterine artery embolization are postpartum hemorrhage and uterine arteriovenous malformations.[3]
"
Essure,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essure,List of vulvovaginal disorders,"Essure was a device for female sterilization. It is a metal coil which when placed into each fallopian tube induces fibrosis and blockage.[1] Essure was designed as an alternative to tubal ligation. However, it was recalled by Bayer in 2018, and the device is no longer sold due to complications secondary to its implantation. The company has reported that several patients implanted with the Essure System for Permanent Birth Control have experienced and/or reported adverse effects, including: perforation of the uterus and/or fallopian tubes, identification of inserts in the abdominal or pelvic cavity, persistent pain, and suspected allergic or hypersensitivity reaction. 
Although designed to remain in place for a lifetime, it was approved based on short-term safety studies. Of the 745 women with implants in the original premarket studies, 92% were followed up at one year, and 25% for two years, for safety outcomes. A 2009 review concluded that Essure appeared safe and effective based on short-term studies, that it was less invasive and could be cheaper than laparoscopic bilateral tubal ligation.[2] About 750,000 women have received the device worldwide.[3]
"
Salpingoophorectomy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salpingoophorectomy,List of vulvovaginal disorders,"In medicine, salpingo-oophorectomy is the removal of an ovary and its fallopian tube.[1][2] This procedure is most frequently associated with prophylactic surgery in response to the discovery of a BRCA mutation, particularly those of the normally tumor suppressing  BRCA1 gene (or, with a statistically lower negative impact, those of the tumour suppressing BRCA2 gene), which can increase the risk of a woman developing ovarian cancer to as high as 65% (as high as 25% for a mutated BRCA2 gene).[3]
"
Hysterectomy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterectomy,List of vulvovaginal disorders,"Hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus and cervix. Supracervical hysterectomy refers to removal of the uterus while the cervix is spared. These procedures may also involve removal of the ovaries (oophorectomy), fallopian tubes (salpingectomy), and other surrounding structures. The term “partial” or “total” hysterectomy are lay-terms that incorrectly describe the addition or omission of oophorectomy at the time of hysterectomy. These procedures are usually performed by a gynecologist. Removal of the uterus is a form of sterilization, rendering the patient unable to bear children (as does removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes) and has surgical risks as well as long-term effects, so the surgery is normally recommended only when other treatment options are not available or have failed. It is the second most commonly performed gynecological surgical procedure, after cesarean section, in the United States.[1] Nearly 68 percent were performed for conditions such as endometriosis, irregular bleeding, and uterine fibroids.[1] It is expected that the frequency of hysterectomies for non-malignant indications will continue to fall given the development of alternative treatment options.[2]

However, since the creation of the Hib vaccine, only two in every 100,000 children contract this type of meningitis.[2]  Five to ten percent of cases can be fatal,[5] although the average mortality rate in developing nations is seventeen percent,[3] mostly due to lack of access to vaccination as well as lack of access to medical care needed to combat the meningitis.

These cases were all fatal, and originally thought to be due to meningitis.  It was not until the autopsies were conducted that the cause of these deaths was confirmed to be infection by H. influenzae aegyptius. Although BPF was thought to be confined to Brazil, other cases occurred in  Australia and the United States during 1984–1990.

Uranium mining,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium_mining,List of pollution-related diseases,"Uranium mining is the process of extraction of uranium ore from the ground. Over 50,000 tons of uranium were produced in 2019. Kazakhstan, Canada, and Australia were the top three uranium producers, respectively, and together account for 68% of world production. Other countries producing more than 1,000 tons per year included Namibia, Niger, Russia, Uzbekistan and China.[2] Nearly all of the world's mined uranium is used to power nuclear power plants. Historically uranium was also used in applications such as uranium glass or ferrouranium but those applications have declined due to the radioactivity and toxicity of uranium and are nowadays mostly supplied with a plentiful cheap supply of depleted uranium which is also used in uranium ammunition. In addition to being cheaper, depleted uranium is also less radioactive due to a lower content of short-lived 234U and 235U than natural uranium.

Glands,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_gland,List of vulvovaginal disorders,"Uterine glands or endometrial glands are tubular glands, lined by a simple columnar epithelium, found in the functional layer of the endometrium that lines the uterus. Their appearance varies during the menstrual cycle. During the proliferative phase, uterine glands appear long due to estrogen secretion by the ovaries. During the secretory phase, the uterine glands become very coiled with wide lumens and produce a glycogen-rich secretion known as histotroph or uterine milk.[1][2] This change corresponds with an increase in blood flow to spiral arteries due to increased progesterone secretion from the corpus luteum. During the pre-menstrual phase, progesterone secretion decreases as the corpus luteum degenerates, which results in decreased blood flow to the spiral arteries. The functional layer of the uterus containing the glands becomes necrotic, and eventually sloughs off during the menstrual phase of the cycle.

Endometrium,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium,List of vulvovaginal disorders,"The endometrium is the inner epithelial layer, along with its mucous membrane, of the mammalian uterus.  It has a basal layer and a functional layer: the basal layer contains stem cells which regenerate the functional layer.[1] The functional layer thickens and then is shed during menstruation in humans and some other mammals, including other apes, Old World monkeys, some species of bat, the elephant shrew[2] and the Cairo spiny mouse.[3] In most other mammals, the endometrium is reabsorbed in the estrous cycle. During pregnancy, the glands and blood vessels in the endometrium further increase in size and number. Vascular spaces fuse and become interconnected, forming the placenta, which supplies oxygen and nutrition to the embryo and fetus.[4][5] The speculated presence of an endometrial microbiota[6]

When infecting the large intestine of humans, they often cause gastroenteritis, enterocolitis, and bloody diarrhea (hence the name ""enterohemorrhagic"") and sometimes cause a severe complication called hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS).[3][4] Cattle are an important natural reservoir for EHEC because the colonised adult ruminants are asymptomatic. This is because they lack vascular expression of the target receptor for Shiga toxins.[5] The group and its subgroups are known by various names. They are distinguished from other strains of intestinal pathogenic E. coli including enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), and diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC).[6]

Oocyte,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte,List of vulvovaginal disorders,"An oocyte (/ˈoʊəsaɪt/, oöcyte, or ovocyte) is a female gametocyte or germ cell involved in reproduction. In other words, it is an immature ovum, or egg cell. An oocyte is produced in a female fetus in the ovary during female gametogenesis. The female germ cells produce a primordial germ cell (PGC), which then undergoes mitosis, forming oogonia.  During oogenesis, the oogonia become primary oocytes. An oocyte is a form of genetic material that can be collected for cryoconservation.

Sustainable transport,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_transport,List of pollution-related diseases,"Sustainable transport is transportation sustainable in terms of their social and environmental impacts. Components for evaluating sustainability include the particular vehicles used for road, water or air transport; the source of energy; and the infrastructure used to accommodate the transport (roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals and terminals). Transport operations and logistics as well as transit-oriented development are also involved in evaluation.[citation needed] Transportation sustainability is largely being measured by transportation system effectiveness and efficiency as well as the environmental and climate impacts of the system.[1] Transport systems have significant impacts on the environment, accounting for between 20% and 25% of world energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.[2] The majority of the emissions, almost 97%, came from direct burning of fossil fuels.[3] In 2019, about 95% of the fuel came from fossil sources. The main source of greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union is transportation. In 2019 it contributes to about 31% of global emissions and 24% of emissions in the EU. In addition, up to the COVID-19 pandemic, emissions have only increased in this one sector.[4][5] Greenhouse gas emissions from transport are increasing at a faster rate than any other energy using sector.[6] Road transport is also a major contributor to local air pollution and smog.[7]

Corona radiata,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona_radiata_(embryology),List of vulvovaginal disorders,"The corona radiata is the innermost layer of the cells of the cumulus oophorus and is directly adjacent to the zona pellucida, the inner protective glycoprotein layer of the ovum.[1] Cumulus oophorus are the cells surrounding corona radiata, and are the cells between corona radiata and follicular antrum. Its main purpose in many animals is to supply vital proteins to the cell.[citation needed] It is formed by follicle cells adhering to the oocyte before it leaves the ovarian follicle, and originates from the squamous granulosa cells present at the primordial stage of follicular development. The corona radiata is formed when the granulosa cells enlarge and become cuboidal, which occurs during the transition from the primordial to primary stage.  These cuboidal granulosa cells, also known as the granulosa radiata, form more layers throughout the maturation process, and remain attached to the zona pellucida after the ovulation of the Graafian follicle.  For fertilization to occur, sperm cells rely on hyaluronidase (an enzyme found in the acrosome of spermatozoa) to disperse the corona radiata from the zona pellucida of the secondary (ovulated) oocyte, thus permitting entry into the perivitelline space and allowing contact between the sperm cell and the nucleus of the oocyte.

The PGF2α induces the contraction of the smooth muscle cells of the theca externa, increasing intrafollicular pressure. This aids in rupture of the mature oocyte, or immature oocyte at the germinal vesicle stage in the canine, along with plasmin and collagenase degradation of the follicle wall.

Cognitive behavioral treatment of eating disorders,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_treatment_of_eating_disorders,List of eating disorders," Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is derived from both the cognitive and behavioral schools of psychology and focuses on the alteration of thoughts and actions with the goal of treating various disorders.[1] The cognitive behavioral treatment of eating disorders emphasizes on the minimization of negative thoughts about body image and the act of eating, and attempts to alter negative and harmful behaviors that are involved in and perpetuate eating disorders.[2] It also encourages the ability to tolerate negative thoughts and feelings as well as the ability to think about food and body perception in a multi-dimensional way.[3] The emphasis is not only placed on altering cognition, but also on tangible practices like making goals and being rewarded for meeting those goals. CBT is a ""time-limited and focused approach"" which means that it is important for the patients of this type of therapy to have particular issues that they want to address when they begin treatment.[4] CBT has also proven to be one of the most effective treatments for eating disorders.[5][2]

This theory was advanced by Albert Bandura as an extension of his social learning theory.[1] The theory states that when people observe a model performing a behavior and the consequences of that behavior, they remember the sequence of events and use this information to guide subsequent behaviors. Observing a model can also prompt the viewer to engage in behavior they already learned.[2][3] Depending on whether people are rewarded or punished for their behavior and the outcome of the behavior, the observer may choose to replicate behavior modeled. Media provides models for a vast array of people in many different environmental settings.

Health belief model,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_belief_model,List of notifiable diseases,"In social psychology, the health belief model (HBM) is a psychological framework used to explain and predict individuals' potentially detrimental behaviors, attitudes and beliefs on their health. Developed in the 1950s by social psychologists at the United States Public Health Service, the model examines how perceptions of susceptibility to illness, the severity of health conditions, the benefits of preventive care, and barriers to healthcare influence behavior. The HBM is widely used in health behavior research and public health interventions to understand and promote engagement in health-protective behaviors.[1][2] It also incorporates concepts similar to the transtheoretical model like self-efficacy, or confidence in one's ability to take action, and identifies the role of cues to action or stimulus, such as health campaigns or medical advice, in prompting behavior change.[3]

The main purposes of providing access to WASH services are to achieve public health gains, implement the human right to water and sanitation, reduce the burden of collecting drinking water for women, and improve education and health outcomes at schools and healthcare facilities. Access to WASH services is an important component of water security.[1] Universal, affordable, and sustainable access to WASH is a key issue within international development, and is the focus of the first two targets of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6).[2] Targets 6.1 and 6.2 aim for equitable and accessible water and sanitation for all. In 2017, it was estimated that 2.3 billion people live without basic sanitation facilities, and 844 million people live without access to safe and clean drinking water.[3] The acronym WASH is used widely by non-governmental organizations and aid agencies in developing countries.

Tropical disease,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_disease,List of notifiable diseases,"Tropical diseases are diseases that are prevalent in or unique to tropical and subtropical regions.[1] The diseases are less prevalent in temperate climates, due in part to the occurrence of a cold season, which controls the insect population by forcing hibernation. However, many were present in northern Europe and northern America in the 17th and 18th centuries before modern understanding of disease causation. The initial impetus for tropical medicine was to protect the health of colonial settlers, notably in India under the British Raj.[2] Insects such as mosquitoes and flies are by far the most common disease carrier, or vector. These insects may carry a parasite, bacterium or virus that is infectious to humans and animals. Most often disease is transmitted by an insect bite, which causes transmission of the infectious agent through subcutaneous blood exchange. Vaccines are not available for most of the diseases listed here, and many do not have cures.

It is similar to biochemistry in its main components such as carbohydrates, lipids, and protein, but it also includes areas such as water, vitamins, minerals, enzymes, food additives, flavors, and colors. This discipline also encompasses how products change under certain food processing techniques and ways either to enhance or to prevent them from happening. An example of enhancing a process would be to encourage fermentation of dairy products with microorganisms that convert lactose to lactic acid; an example of preventing a process would be stopping the browning on the surface of freshly cut apples using lemon juice or other acidulated water.

Z-test tests the mean of a distribution. For each significance level in the confidence interval, the Z-test has a single critical value (for example, 1.96 for 5% two-tailed), which makes it more convenient than the Student's t-test whose critical values are defined by the sample size (through the corresponding degrees of freedom). Both the Z-test and Student's t-test have similarities in that they both help determine the significance of a set of data. However, the Z-test is rarely used in practice because the population deviation is difficult to determine.

Student's ,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test,List of notifiable diseases,"Student's t-test is a statistical test used to test whether the difference between the response of two groups is statistically significant or not. It is any statistical hypothesis test in which the test statistic follows a Student's t-distribution under the null hypothesis. It is most commonly applied when the test statistic would follow a normal distribution if the value of a scaling term in the test statistic were known (typically, the scaling term is unknown and is therefore a nuisance parameter). When the scaling term is estimated based on the data, the test statistic—under certain conditions—follows a Student's t distribution. The t-test's most common application is to test whether the means of two populations are significantly different. In many cases, a Z-test will yield very similar results to a t-test because the latter converges to the former as the size of the dataset increases.

Sanitation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation,List of notifiable diseases,"Sanitation refers to public health conditions related to clean drinking water and treatment and disposal of human excreta and sewage.[1] Preventing human contact with feces is part of sanitation, as is hand washing with soap. Sanitation systems aim to protect human health by providing a clean environment that will stop the transmission of disease, especially through the fecal–oral route.[2] For example, diarrhea, a main cause of malnutrition and stunted growth in children, can be reduced through adequate sanitation.[3] There are many other diseases which are easily transmitted in communities that have low levels of sanitation, such as ascariasis (a type of intestinal worm infection or helminthiasis), cholera, hepatitis, polio, schistosomiasis, and trachoma, to name just a few.

Soil transmitted helminthiasis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil-transmitted_helminthiasis,List of pollution-related diseases,"Soil-transmitted helminthiasis is a type of worm  infection (helminthiasis) caused by different species of roundworms. It is caused specifically by worms transmitted through soil contaminated with faecal matter and are known as soil-transmitted helminths. Three types of soil-transmitted helminthiasis can be distinguished: ascariasis, hookworm infection and whipworm infection. These three types of infection are therefore caused by the large roundworm A. lumbricoides, the hookworms Necator americanus or Ancylostoma duodenale and by the whipworm Trichuris trichiura.

The different forms of viral encephalitis are called viral encephalitides. It is the most common type of encephalitis and often occurs with viral meningitis. Encephalitic viruses first cause infection and replicate outside of the central nervous system (CNS), most reaching the CNS through the circulatory system and a minority from nerve endings toward the CNS. Once in the brain, the virus and the host's inflammatory response disrupt neural function, leading to illness and complications, many of which frequently are neurological in nature, such as impaired motor skills and altered behavior.

Cerebrovascular disease,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrovascular_disease,List of pollution-related diseases,"Cerebrovascular disease includes a variety of medical conditions that affect the blood vessels of the brain and the cerebral circulation. Arteries supplying oxygen and nutrients to the brain are often damaged or deformed in these disorders.[2] The most common presentation of cerebrovascular disease is an ischemic stroke or mini-stroke and sometimes a hemorrhagic stroke.[2] Hypertension (high blood pressure) is the most important contributing risk factor for stroke and cerebrovascular diseases as it can change the structure of blood vessels and result in atherosclerosis.[5] Atherosclerosis narrows blood vessels in the brain, resulting in decreased cerebral perfusion. Other risk factors that contribute to stroke include smoking and diabetes.[6] Narrowed cerebral arteries can lead to ischemic stroke, but continually elevated blood pressure can also cause tearing of vessels, leading to a hemorrhagic stroke.[4]

Erotic sexual denial,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erotic_sexual_denial,List of vulvovaginal disorders,"
Erotic sexual denial is a popular form of sexual activity whereby sexual gratification for one or both partners is delayed or ""denied"" sexual experiences in order to increase erotic arousal and/or tension.[1] It is commonly used as sex play within the context of a mild dominance and submission relationship, though it can also be a solo practice. When used in the context of dominance and submission, the dominant partner is often encouraged to prioritize their own sexual pleasure over that of their submissive partner. The submissive partner receives gratification from providing sexual pleasure to their partner and from the feelings of vulnerability and tension that come from having their own sexual pleasure controlled by another.[2] The prohibited sexual experience can be narrowly or broadly defined for a specific or indeterminate length of time, depending on the practitioner. The experience withheld can be any favored or desired sexual activities, such as specific acts or positions, provided it is something the practitioner wants.

Injury prevention,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury_prevention,List of notifiable diseases,"Injury prevention is an effort to prevent or reduce the severity of bodily injuries caused by external mechanisms, such as accidents, before they occur.  Injury prevention is a component of safety and public health, and its goal is to improve the health of the population by preventing injuries and hence improving quality of life. Among laypersons, the term ""accidental injury"" is often used.  However, ""accidental"" implies the causes of injuries are random in nature.[1]  Researchers prefer the term ""unintentional injury"" to refer to injuries that are nonvolitional but often preventable. Data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control show that unintentional injuries are a significant public health concern: they are by far the leading cause of death from ages 1 through 44.[2]  During these years, unintentional injuries account for more deaths than the next three leading causes of death combined.[2] Unintentional injuries also account for the top ten sources of nonfatal emergency room visits for persons up to age 9 and nine of the top ten sources of nonfatal emergency room visits for persons over the age of 9.[3]

These hazards or stressors are typically divided into the categories biological, chemical, physical, ergonomic and psychosocial.[1]  The risk of a health effect from a given stressor is a function of the hazard multiplied by the exposure to the individual or group.[2] For chemicals, the hazard can be understood by the dose response profile most often based on toxicological studies or models. Occupational hygienists work closely with toxicologists (see Toxicology) for understanding chemical hazards, physicists (see Physics) for physical hazards, and physicians and microbiologists for biological hazards (see Microbiology, Tropical medicine, Infection). Environmental and occupational hygienists are considered experts in exposure science and exposure risk management.  Depending on an individual's type of job, a hygienist will apply their exposure science expertise for the protection of workers, consumers and/or communities.

These theories cite environmental, personal, and behavioural characteristics as the major factors in behavioural determination. In recent years, there has been increased interest in the application of these theories in the areas of health, education, criminology, energy and international development with the hope that understanding behavioural change will improve the services offered in these areas. Some scholars have recently introduced a distinction between models of behavior and theories of change.[1] Whereas models of behavior are more diagnostic and geared towards understanding the psychological factors that explain or predict a specific behavior, theories of change are more process-oriented and generally aimed at changing a given behavior. Thus, from this perspective, understanding and changing behavior are two separate but complementary lines of scientific investigation.

The orgasm gap or pleasure gap is the disparity in sexual satisfaction—specifically the unequal frequency in achieving orgasm during sexual encounters—between heterosexual men and women. Across every demographic that has been studied, women report the lowest frequency of reaching orgasm during sexual encounters with men. Researchers believe that multiple causes contribute to the orgasm gap.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] Orgasm gap researcher Laurie Mintz argues that the primary reason for this form of gender inequality is due to ""our cultural ignorance of the clitoris"" and that it is commonplace to ""mislabel women's genitals by the one part (the vagina) that gives men, but not women, reliable orgasms.""[11][5]

Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to Josiah Warren and to experimental communities, viewing sexual freedom as an expression of an individual's self-ownership. Free love particularly stressed women's rights. In New York's Greenwich Village, ""bohemian"" feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for both men and women. In Europe and North America, the free love movement combined ideas revived from utopian socialism with anarchism and feminism to attack the ""hypocritical"" sexual morality of the Victorian era.

"
optical scattering,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_scattering,List of heart disorders,"In physics, scattering is a wide range of physical processes where moving particles or radiation of some form, such as light or sound, are forced to deviate from a straight trajectory by localized non-uniformities (including particles and radiation) in the medium through which they pass. In conventional use, this also includes deviation of reflected radiation from the angle predicted by the law of reflection. Reflections of radiation that undergo scattering are often called diffuse reflections and unscattered reflections are called specular (mirror-like) reflections. Originally, the term was confined to light scattering (going back at least as far as Isaac Newton in the 17th century[1]). As more ""ray""-like phenomena were discovered, the idea of scattering was extended to them, so that William Herschel could refer to the scattering of ""heat rays"" (not then recognized as electromagnetic in nature) in 1800.[2] John Tyndall, a pioneer in light scattering research, noted the connection between light scattering and acoustic scattering in the 1870s.[3] Near the end of the 19th century, the scattering of cathode rays (electron beams)[4] and X-rays[5] was observed and discussed. With the discovery of subatomic particles (e.g. Ernest Rutherford in 1911[6]) and the development of quantum theory in the 20th century, the sense of the term became broader as it was recognized that the same mathematical frameworks used in light scattering could be applied to many other phenomena.

"
neuroendocrine,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrine,List of eating disorders,"Neuroendocrine cells are cells that receive neuronal input (through neurotransmitters released by nerve cells or neurosecretory cells) and, as a consequence of this input, release messenger molecules (hormones) into the blood. In this way they bring about an integration between the nervous system and the endocrine system, a process known as neuroendocrine integration. An example of a neuroendocrine cell is a cell of the adrenal medulla (innermost part of the adrenal gland), which releases adrenaline to the blood. The adrenal medullary cells are controlled by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. These cells are modified postganglionic neurons. Autonomic nerve fibers lead directly to them from the central nervous system. The adrenal medullary hormones are kept in vesicles much in the same way neurotransmitters are kept in neuronal vesicles. Hormonal effects can last up to ten times longer than those of neurotransmitters.[citation needed] Sympathetic nerve fiber impulses stimulate the release of adrenal medullary hormones. In this way the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system and the medullary secretions function together.

Soil,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_pollution,List of notifiable diseases,"Soil contamination, soil pollution, or land pollution as a part of land degradation is caused by the presence of xenobiotic (human-made) chemicals or other alteration in the natural soil environment.  It is typically caused by industrial activity, agricultural chemicals or improper disposal of waste. The most common chemicals involved are petroleum hydrocarbons, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (such as naphthalene and benzo(a)pyrene), solvents, pesticides, lead, and other heavy metals.[1] Contamination is correlated with the degree of industrialization and intensity of chemical substance. The concern over soil contamination stems primarily from health risks, from direct contact with the contaminated soil, vapour from the contaminants, or from secondary contamination of water supplies within and underlying the soil.[2] Mapping of contaminated soil sites and the resulting clean ups are time-consuming and expensive tasks, and require expertise in geology, hydrology, chemistry, computer modelling, and GIS in Environmental Contamination, as well as an appreciation of the history of industrial chemistry.[3]

Nutrient,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient_pollution,List of pollution-related diseases,"Nutrient pollution is a form of water pollution caused by too many nutrients entering the water. It is a primary cause of eutrophication of surface waters (lakes, rivers and coastal waters), in which excess nutrients, usually nitrogen or phosphorus, stimulate algal growth.[1] Sources of nutrient pollution include surface runoff from farms, waste from septic tanks and feedlots, and emissions from burning fuels. Raw sewage, which is rich in nutrients, also contributes to the issue when dumped in water bodies. Excess nitrogen causes environmental problems such as harmful algal blooms, hypoxia, acid rain, nitrogen saturation in forests, and climate change.[2]

Oil spill,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_spill,List of pollution-related diseases,"An oil spill is the release of a liquid petroleum hydrocarbon into the environment, especially the marine ecosystem, due to human activity, and is a form of pollution. The term is usually given to marine oil spills, where oil is released into the ocean or coastal waters, but spills may also occur on land. Oil spills can result from the release of crude oil from tankers, offshore platforms, drilling rigs, and wells. They may also involve spills of refined petroleum products, such as gasoline and diesel fuel, as well as their by-products. Additionally, heavier fuels used by large ships, such as bunker fuel, or spills of any oily refuse or waste oil, contribute to such incidents. These spills can have severe environmental and economic consequences.

The results of monitoring are usually reviewed, analyzed statistically, and published. A monitoring programme is designed around the intended use of the data before monitoring starts.
"
Nonpoint source,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpoint_source_pollution,List of pollution-related diseases,"Nonpoint source (NPS) pollution refers to diffuse contamination (or pollution) of water or air that does not originate from a single discrete source. This type of pollution is often the cumulative effect of small amounts of contaminants gathered from a large area. It is in contrast to point source pollution which results from a single source. Nonpoint source pollution generally results from land runoff, precipitation, atmospheric deposition, drainage, seepage, or hydrological modification (rainfall and snowmelt) where tracing pollution back to a single source is difficult.[1] Nonpoint source water pollution affects a water body from sources such as polluted runoff from agricultural areas draining into a river, or wind-borne debris blowing out to sea. Nonpoint source air pollution affects air quality, from sources such as smokestacks or car tailpipes. Although these pollutants have originated from a point source, the long-range transport ability and multiple sources of the pollutant make it a nonpoint source of pollution; if the discharges were to occur to a body of water or into the atmosphere at a single location, the pollution would be single-point.

In the 1920s, the farming community began also to use sewage sludge from local wastewater treatment plants. Scientific research over many years has confirmed that these biosolids contain similar nutrients to those in animal manures. Biosolids that are used as fertilizer in farming  are usually treated to help to prevent disease-causing pathogens from spreading to the public.[2] Some sewage sludge can not qualify as biosolids due to persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals, radionuclides, and heavy metals at levels sufficient to contaminate soil and water when applied to land.

Vaginal lubrication,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_lubrication,List of vulvovaginal disorders,"Vaginal lubrication is a naturally produced fluid that lubricates the vagina. Vaginal lubrication production increases significantly during sexual arousal in anticipation of sexual intercourse.[1] Vaginal dryness is the condition in which this lubrication is insufficient, and sometimes artificial lubricants are used to augment it. Without sufficient lubrication, sexual intercourse can be painful. The vaginal lining has no glands, and therefore the vagina must rely on other methods of lubrication. Plasma from the vaginal walls due to vascular engorgement is considered to be the chief lubrication source, and the Bartholin's glands, located slightly below and to the left and right of the introitus (vaginal opening), also secrete mucus to augment vaginal wall secretions. Near ovulation, cervical mucus provides additional lubrication.

They are expressed in skeletal and cardiac myocytes. Troponin T binds to tropomyosin and helps position it on actin,[2] and together with the rest of the troponin complex, modulates contraction of striated muscle.[3]  The cardiac subtype of troponin T is especially useful in the laboratory diagnosis of heart attack because it is released into the blood-stream when damage to heart muscle occurs.[4] It was discovered by the German physician Hugo A. Katus at the University of Heidelberg, who also developed the troponin T assay.

troponin I,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troponin_I,List of heart disorders,"Troponin I is a cardiac and skeletal muscle protein family. It is a part of the troponin protein complex, where it binds to actin in thin myofilaments to hold the actin-tropomyosin complex in place. Troponin I prevents myosin from binding to actin in relaxed muscle. When calcium binds to the troponin C, it causes conformational changes which lead to dislocation of troponin I. Afterwards, tropomyosin leaves the binding site for myosin on actin leading to contraction of muscle. The letter I is given due to its inhibitory character. It is a useful marker in the laboratory diagnosis of heart attack.[2]  It occurs in different plasma concentration but the same circumstances as troponin T - either test can be performed for confirmation of cardiac muscle damage and laboratories usually offer one test or the other.[3]

Cultural competence,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_competence_in_health_care,List of notifiable diseases,"Cultural competence in healthcare refers to the ability of healthcare professionals to effectively understand and respect patients' diverse values, beliefs, and feelings.[1][2] This process includes consideration of the individual social, cultural, and psychological needs of patients for effective cross-cultural communication with their health care providers.[3] The goal of cultural competence in health care is to reduce health disparities and to provide optimal care to patients regardless of their race, gender, ethnic background, native language, and religious or cultural beliefs. Ethnocentrism is the belief that one’s culture is better than others.[4] This is a bias that is easy to overlook which is why it is important that healthcare workers are aware of this possible bias so they can learn how to dismantle it. Cultural competency training is important in health care fields where human interaction is common, including medicine, nursing, allied health, mental health, social work, pharmacy, oral health, and public health fields. This training is necessary in helping eliminate any traces of ethnocentrism in healthcare workers.

Intra-aortic balloon pump,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intra-aortic_balloon_pump,List of heart disorders,"The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is a mechanical device that increases myocardial oxygen perfusion and indirectly increases cardiac output through afterload reduction. It consists of a cylindrical polyurethane balloon that sits in the aorta, approximately 2 centimeters (0.79 in) from the left subclavian artery.[1] The balloon inflates and deflates via counter pulsation, meaning it actively deflates in systole and inflates in diastole. Systolic deflation decreases afterload through a vacuum effect and indirectly increases forward flow from the heart. Diastolic inflation increases blood flow to the coronary arteries via retrograde flow. These actions combine to decrease myocardial oxygen demand and increase myocardial oxygen supply.[2][3]

"
Defibrillator,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defibrillator,List of heart disorders,"Defibrillation is a treatment for life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, specifically ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib) and non-perfusing ventricular tachycardia (V-Tach).[1][2] A defibrillator delivers a dose of electric current (often called a counter-shock) to the heart. Although not fully understood, this process depolarizes a large amount of the heart muscle, ending the arrhythmia. Subsequently, the body's natural pacemaker in the sinoatrial node of the heart is able to re-establish normal sinus rhythm.[3] A heart which is in asystole (flatline) cannot be restarted by a defibrillator; it would be treated only by cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and medication, and then by cardioversion or defibrillation if it converts into a shockable rhythm.

Global distillation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_distillation,List of pollution-related diseases,"Global distillation, also known as the Grasshopper effect, is the geochemical process by which certain chemicals, most notably persistent organic pollutants (POPs), are vaporized and transported from warmer to colder regions of the Earth, particularly the poles and mountain tops, where they condense. Other chemicals include acidifying acids (SOx) and heavy metals.[1] The first documented use of the term was in 1975 by E.D. Goldberg to describe the vaporization of synthetic halogenated hydrocarbons which is enhanced by the presence of water.[2] However, this effect was only believed to occur within a defined “pollution band” in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Soon after, evidence of this effect was found in arctic food as well as its atmosphere.[3] Since then, relatively high concentrations of POPs have been found in the Arctic soil and water, as well as the bodies of animals and people who live there, even though most of the chemicals have not been used in the region in appreciable amounts.[4][5]

Haze,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haze,List of pollution-related diseases,"Haze is traditionally an atmospheric phenomenon in which dust, smoke, and other dry particulates suspended in air obscure visibility and the clarity of the sky. The World Meteorological Organization manual of codes includes a classification of particulates causing horizontal obscuration into categories of fog, ice fog, steam fog, mist, haze, smoke, volcanic ash, dust, sand, and snow.[1] Sources for particles that cause haze include farming (stubble burning, ploughing in dry weather), traffic, industry, windy weather, volcanic activity and wildfires.
Seen from afar (e.g. an approaching airplane) and depending on the direction of view with respect to the Sun, haze may appear brownish or bluish, while mist tends to be bluish grey instead. Whereas haze often is considered a phenomenon occurring in dry air, mist formation is a phenomenon in saturated, humid air. However, haze particles may act as condensation nuclei that leads to the subsequent vapor condensation and formation of mist droplets; such forms of haze are known as ""wet haze"".

Combustion does not always result in fire, because a flame is only visible when substances undergoing combustion vaporize, but when it does, a flame is a characteristic indicator of the reaction. While activation energy must be supplied to initiate combustion (e.g., using a lit match to light a fire), the heat from a flame may provide enough energy to make the reaction self-sustaining. The study of combustion is known as combustion science.

Pregnancy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence_and_pregnancy,List of vulvovaginal disorders,"Pregnancy when coupled with domestic violence is a form of intimate partner violence (IPV) where health risks may be amplified. Abuse during pregnancy, whether physical, verbal or emotional, produces many adverse physical and psychological effects for both the mother and fetus. Domestic violence during pregnancy is categorized as abusive behavior towards a pregnant woman, where the pattern of abuse can often change in terms of severity and frequency of violence. Abuse may be a long-standing problem in a relationship that continues after a woman becomes pregnant or it may commence in pregnancy.[1] Although female-to-male partner violence occurs in these settings, the overwhelming form of domestic violence is perpetrated by men against women.[2] Pregnancy provides a unique opportunity for healthcare workers to screen women for domestic violence though a recent review found that the best way in which to do this is unclear.[3] Reducing domestic violence in pregnancy should improve outcomes for mothers and babies though more good quality studies are needed to work out effective ways of screening pregnant women.[3]

When the AQI is high, governmental bodies generally encourage people to reduce physical activity outdoors, or even avoid going out altogether. When wildfires result in a high AQI, the use of a mask (such as an N95 respirator) outdoors and an air purifier (incorporating both HEPA and activated carbon filters) indoors are also encouraged.[4][5]

It can be defined as any duplication of a region of DNA that contains a gene.  Gene duplications can arise as products of several types of errors in DNA replication and repair machinery as well as through fortuitous capture by selfish genetic elements.  Common sources of gene duplications include ectopic recombination,  retrotransposition event, aneuploidy, polyploidy, and replication slippage.[1]
"
Deletion,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletion_(genetics),List of genetic disorders,"In genetics, a deletion (also called gene deletion, deficiency, or deletion mutation) (sign: Δ) is a mutation (a genetic aberration) in which a part of a chromosome or a sequence of DNA is left out during DNA replication. Any number of nucleotides can be deleted, from a single base to an entire piece of chromosome.[1] Some chromosomes have fragile spots where breaks occur, which result in the deletion of a part of the chromosome. The breaks can be induced by heat, viruses, radiation, or chemical reactions. When a chromosome breaks, if a part of it is deleted or lost, the missing piece of chromosome is referred to as a deletion or a deficiency.[2]

Mood Disorder Questionnaire,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_Disorder_Questionnaire,List of mood disorders,"The Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) is a self-report questionnaire designed to help detect bipolar disorder.[1] It focuses on symptoms of hypomania and mania, which are the mood states that separate bipolar disorders from other types of depression and mood disorder.  It has 5 main questions, and the first question has 13 parts, for a total of 17 questions. The MDQ was originally tested with adults, but it also has been studied in adolescents ages 11 years and above. It takes approximately 5–10 minutes to complete. In 2006, a parent-report version was created to allow for assessment of bipolar symptoms in children or adolescents from a caregiver perspective, with the research looking at youths as young as 5 years old.[2] The MDQ has become one of the most widely studied and used questionnaires for bipolar disorder, and it has been translated into more than a dozen languages.[3][4][5]

General Behavior Inventory,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Behavior_Inventory,List of mood disorders,"The General Behavior Inventory (GBI) is a 73-question psychological self-report assessment tool designed by Richard Depue[1][2][failed verification] and colleagues to identify the presence and severity of manic and depressive moods in adults, as well as to assess for cyclothymia. It is one of the most widely used psychometric tests for measuring the severity of bipolar disorder and the fluctuation of symptoms over time. The GBI is intended to be administered for adult populations; however, it has been adapted into versions that allow for juvenile populations (for parents to rate their offspring), as well as a short version that allows for it to be used as a screening test.
"
Hypomania Checklist,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania_Checklist,List of mood disorders,"The Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32) is a questionnaire developed by Dr. Jules Angst to identify hypomanic features in patients with major depressive disorder in order to help recognize bipolar II disorder and other bipolar spectrum disorders[1] when people seek help in primary care and other general medical settings. It asks about 32 behaviors and mental states that are either aspects of hypomania or features associated with mood disorders. It uses short phrases and simple language, making it easy to read. The University of Zurich holds the copyright, and the HCL-32 is available for use at no charge. More recent work has focused on validating translations and testing whether shorter versions still perform well enough to be helpful clinically.[2] Recent meta-analyses find that it is one of the most accurate assessments available for detecting hypomania, doing better than other options at recognizing bipolar II disorder.[3][4]

diabetic nephropathy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_nephropathy,List of heart disorders,"Diabetic nephropathy, also known as diabetic kidney disease,[5] is the chronic loss of kidney function occurring in those with diabetes mellitus. Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) globally. The triad of protein leaking into the urine (proteinuria or albuminuria), rising blood pressure with hypertension and then falling renal function is common to many forms of CKD. Protein loss in the urine due to damage of the glomeruli may become massive, and cause a low serum albumin with resulting generalized body swelling (edema) so called nephrotic syndrome. Likewise, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) may progressively fall from a normal of over 90 ml/min/1.73m2 to less than 15, at which point the patient is said to have end-stage renal disease.[6] It usually is slowly progressive over years.[7]

Carotid artery dissection,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotid_artery_dissection,List of heart disorders,"Carotid artery dissection is a serious condition in which a tear forms in one of the two main carotid arteries in the neck, allowing blood to enter the artery wall and separate its layers (dissection). This separation can lead to the formation of a blood clot, narrowing of the artery, and restricted blood flow to the brain, potentially resulting in stroke. Symptoms vary depending on the extent and location of the dissection and may include a sudden, severe headache, neck or facial pain, vision changes, a drooping eyelid (Horner's syndrome), and stroke-like symptoms such as weakness or numbness on one side of the body, difficulty speaking, or loss of coordination.

traumatic aortic rupture,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_aortic_rupture,List of heart disorders,"Traumatic aortic rupture, also called traumatic aortic disruption or transection,  is a condition in which the aorta, the largest artery in the body, is torn or ruptured as a result of trauma to the body. The condition is frequently fatal due to the profuse bleeding that results from the rupture.  Since the aorta branches directly from the heart to supply blood to the rest of the body, the pressure within it is very great, and blood may be pumped out of a tear in the blood vessel very rapidly. This can quickly result in shock and death.  Thus traumatic aortic rupture is a common killer in automotive accidents and other traumas,[1] with up to  18% of deaths that occur in automobile collisions being related to the injury.[2]  In fact, aortic disruption due to blunt chest trauma is the second leading cause of injury death behind traumatic brain injury.[3][4]

thrombus,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus,List of heart disorders,"A thrombus (pl. thrombi) is a solid or semisolid aggregate from constituents of the blood (platelets, fibrin, red blood cells, white blood cells) within the circulatory system during life.[1][2] While a blood clot is the final product of the blood coagulation step in hemostasis in or out of the circulatory system. There are two components to a thrombus: aggregated platelets and red blood cells that form a plug, and a mesh of cross-linked fibrin protein. The substance making up a thrombus is sometimes called cruor. A thrombus is a healthy response to injury intended to stop and prevent further bleeding, but can be harmful in thrombosis, when a clot obstructs blood flow through a healthy blood vessel in the circulatory system.

double aortic arch,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_aortic_arch,List of heart disorders,"Double aortic arch  is a relatively rare congenital cardiovascular malformation.  DAA is an anomaly of the aortic arch in which two aortic arches  form a complete vascular ring that can compress the trachea and/or esophagus.[1][2]   Most commonly there is a larger (dominant) right arch behind and a smaller (hypoplastic) left aortic arch in front of the trachea/esophagus. The two arches join to form the descending aorta which is usually on the left side (but may be right-sided or in the midline).  In some cases the end of the smaller left aortic arch closes (left atretic arch) and the vascular tissue becomes a fibrous cord. Although in these cases a complete ring of two patent aortic arches is not present, the term ‘vascular ring’ is the accepted generic term even in these anomalies.

It is one of two fetal cardiac shunts, the other being the ductus arteriosus (which allows blood that still escapes to the right ventricle to bypass the pulmonary circulation). Another similar adaptation in the fetus is the ductus venosus. In most individuals, the foramen ovale closes at birth. It later forms the fossa ovalis.

There is a gap between the ascending and descending thoracic aorta. In a sense it is the complete form of a coarctation of the aorta. Almost all patients also have other cardiac anomalies, including a ventricular septal defect (VSD), aorto-pulmonary window, and truncus arteriosus. There are three types of interrupted aortic arch, with type B being the most common. Interrupted aortic arch (especially Type B) is often associated with DiGeorge syndrome.
"
Bicuspid aortic valve,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicuspid_aortic_valve,List of heart disorders,"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a form of heart disease in which two of the leaflets of the aortic valve fuse during development in the womb resulting in a two-leaflet (bicuspid) valve instead of the normal three-leaflet (tricuspid) valve. BAV is the most common cause of heart disease present at birth and affects approximately 1.3% of adults.[2] Normally, the mitral valve is the only bicuspid valve and this is situated between the heart's left atrium and left ventricle. Heart valves play a crucial role in ensuring the unidirectional flow of blood from the atria to the ventricles, or from the ventricle to the aorta or pulmonary trunk. BAV is normally inherited.
"
Coarctation of the aorta,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarctation_of_the_aorta,List of heart disorders,"Coarctation of the aorta (CoA)[1][2] is a congenital condition whereby the aorta is narrow, usually in the area where the ductus arteriosus (ligamentum arteriosum after regression) inserts. The word coarctation means ""pressing or drawing together; narrowing"". Coarctations are most common in the aortic arch. The arch may be small in babies with coarctations. Other heart defects may also occur when coarctation is present, typically occurring on the left side of the heart. When a patient has a coarctation, the left ventricle has to work harder. Since the aorta is narrowed, the left ventricle must generate a much higher pressure than normal in order to force enough blood through the aorta to deliver blood to the lower part of the body. If the narrowing is severe enough, the left ventricle may not be strong enough to push blood through the coarctation, thus resulting in a lack of blood to the lower half of the body. Physiologically its complete form is manifested as interrupted aortic arch.[citation needed]
"
patent foramen ovale,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_foramen_ovale,List of heart disorders,"Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a congenital heart defect in which blood flows between the atria (upper chambers) of the heart.  Some flow is a normal condition both pre-birth and immediately post-birth via the foramen ovale; however, when this does not naturally close after birth it is referred to as a patent (open) foramen ovale (PFO).

Trait Specified,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder_trait_specified,List of personality disorders,"The Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders, introduced in Section III of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), provides an alternative conceptual framework for the classification and understanding of personality disorders. It differs from previous DSM models of personality disorders, including the standard model in the DSM-5, in that it is based on a dimensional approach to personality pathology, whereas previous models have been characterized by rigid diagnostic criteria for each individual personality disorder.[1] The alternative model, on the other hand, aims to better capture the complexity of personality pathology by assessing impairments in personality functioning and pathological personality traits. Designed to address limitations of the categorical system—such as excessive comorbidity and lack of diagnostic precision[1]—the alternative model offers a nuanced perspective that aligns more closely with contemporary research and clinical practice. Its focus on the interplay between personality traits and functioning aims to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning, though it remains a topic of ongoing debate and research.[2] The alternative model features the following specified personality disorders, in alphabetical order: antisocial, avoidant, borderline, narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, and schizotypal.[1] This constitutes a reduction of entities, as the standard model contains the additional diagnoses of dependent, histrionic, paranoid, and schizoid personality disorders.

Remission of all symptoms is complete with patients returning to the previous level of functioning. It may follow a period of extreme stress including the loss of a loved one.  Most patients with this condition under DSM-5 would be classified as having acute and transient psychotic disorders under ICD-10.  Prior to DSM-IV, this condition was called ""brief reactive psychosis.""[1][2] This condition may or may not be recurrent, and it should not be caused by another condition.
"
Physical dependence,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_dependence,List of mood disorders,"Physical dependence is a physical condition caused by chronic use of a tolerance-forming drug, in which abrupt or gradual drug withdrawal causes unpleasant physical symptoms.[4][5] Physical dependence can develop from low-dose therapeutic use of certain medications such as benzodiazepines, opioids, stimulants, antiepileptics and antidepressants, as well as the recreational misuse of drugs such as alcohol, opioids and benzodiazepines. The higher the dose used, the greater the duration of use, and the earlier age use began are predictive of worsened physical dependence and thus more severe withdrawal syndromes. Acute withdrawal syndromes can last days, weeks or months. Protracted withdrawal syndrome, also known as post-acute-withdrawal syndrome or ""PAWS"", is a low-grade continuation of some of the symptoms of acute withdrawal, typically in a remitting-relapsing pattern, often resulting in relapse and prolonged disability of a degree to preclude the possibility of lawful employment. Protracted withdrawal syndrome can last for months, years, or depending on individual factors, indefinitely. Protracted withdrawal syndrome is noted to be most often caused by benzodiazepines.[6] To dispel the popular misassociation with addiction, physical dependence to medications is sometimes compared to dependence on insulin by persons with diabetes.[7]

Pulmonary valve,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_valve,List of heart disorders,"The pulmonary valve (sometimes referred to as the pulmonic valve) is a valve of the heart that lies between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, and has three cusps. It is one of the four valves of the heart and one of the two semilunar valves, the other being the aortic valve. Similar to the aortic valve,[1] the pulmonary valve opens in ventricular systole when the pressure in the right ventricle rises above the pressure in the pulmonary artery.  At the end of ventricular systole, when the pressure in the right ventricle falls rapidly, the pressure in the pulmonary artery closes the pulmonary valve.

Mitral stenosis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_stenosis,List of heart disorders,"Mitral stenosis is a valvular heart disease characterized by the narrowing of the opening of the mitral valve of the heart.[1] It is almost always caused by rheumatic valvular heart disease. Normally, the mitral valve is about 5 cm2 during diastole. Any decrease in area below 2 cm2 causes mitral stenosis. Early diagnosis of mitral stenosis in pregnancy is very important as the heart cannot tolerate increased cardiac output demand as in the case of exercise and pregnancy. Atrial fibrillation is a common complication of resulting left atrial enlargement, which can lead to systemic thromboembolic complications such as stroke.[2]
"
Mitral valve repair,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve_repair,List of heart disorders,"Mitral valve repair is a cardiac surgery procedure performed by cardiac surgeons to treat stenosis (narrowing) or regurgitation (leakage) of the mitral valve. The mitral valve is the ""inflow valve"" for the left side of the heart. Blood flows from the lungs, where it picks up oxygen, through the pulmonary veins, to the left atrium of the heart. After the left atrium fills with blood, the mitral valve allows blood to flow from the left atrium into the heart's main pumping chamber called the left ventricle. It then closes to keep blood from leaking back into the left atrium or lungs when the ventricle contracts (squeezes) to push blood out to the body. It has two flaps, or leaflets, known as cusps.

aorta,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta,List of heart disorders,"The aorta (/eɪˈɔːrtə/ ay-OR-tə; pl.: aortas or aortae) is the main and largest artery in the human body, originating from the left ventricle of the heart, branching upwards immediately after, and extending down to the abdomen, where it splits at the aortic bifurcation into two smaller arteries (the common iliac arteries). The aorta distributes oxygenated blood to all parts of the body through the systemic circulation.[1]
"
Aortic valve,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_valve,List of heart disorders,"The aortic valve is a valve in the heart of humans and most other animals, located between the left ventricle and the aorta. It is one of the four valves of the heart and one of the two semilunar valves, the other being the pulmonary valve.

Milieu therapy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milieu_therapy,List of personality disorders,"Milieu therapy is a form of psychotherapy that involves the use of therapeutic communities. Patients join a group of around 30, for between 9 and 18 months. During their stay, patients are encouraged to take responsibility for themselves and the others within the unit, based upon a hierarchy of collective consequences. Patients are expected to hold one another to following rules, with more senior patients expected to model appropriate behavior for newer patients. If one patient violates the rules, others who were aware of the violation but did not intervene may also be held to account to varying extents based upon their involvement. Milieu therapy is thought to be of value in treating personality disorders and behavioural problems, and can also be used with a goal of stimulating the patient's remaining cognitive-communicative abilities. Organizations known to use milieu therapy include Cassel Hospital, in London, Forest Heights Lodge in Evergreen, CO,[1][2] the United States Veteran's Administration,[3] and the Kansas Industrial School for Girls in Beloit, Kansas.[4]

abnormal behavior,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormality_(behavior),List of personality disorders,"Abnormality (or dysfunctional behavior or maladaptive behavior or deviant behavior) is a behavioral characteristic assigned to those with conditions that are regarded as dysfunctional.[1][2] Behavior is considered to be abnormal when it is atypical or out of the ordinary, consists of undesirable behavior, and results in impairment in the individual's functioning.[3] As applied to humans, abnormality may also encompass deviance, which refers to behavior that is considered to transgress social norms. The definition of abnormal behavior in humans is an often debated issue in abnormal psychology.[4]

immature,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maturity_(psychological),List of personality disorders,"In psychology, maturity can be operationally defined as the level of psychological functioning (measured through standards like the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children) one can attain, after which the level of psychological functioning no longer increases much with age. However, beyond this, integration is also an aspect of maturation,[1] such as the integration of personality, where the behavioral patterns, motives and other traits of a person are gradually brought together, to work together effectively with little to no conflict between them, as an organized whole,[2] e.g., bringing a person's various motives together into a purpose in life. Case in point: adult development and maturity theories include the purpose in life concept, in which maturity emphasizes a clear comprehension of life's purpose, directedness, and intentionality, which contributes to the feeling that life is meaningful.[3]

pathological,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathological,List of personality disorders,"Pathology is the study of disease.[1] The word pathology also refers to the study of disease in general, incorporating a wide range of biology research fields and medical practices. However, when used in the context of modern medical treatment, the term is often used in a narrower fashion to refer to processes and tests that fall within the contemporary medical field of ""general pathology"", an area that includes a number of distinct but inter-related medical specialties that diagnose disease, mostly through analysis of tissue and human cell samples. Idiomatically, ""a pathology"" may also refer to the predicted or actual progression of particular diseases (as in the statement ""the many different forms of cancer have diverse pathologies"", in which case a more proper choice of word would be ""pathophysiologies""). The suffix pathy is sometimes used to indicate a state of disease in cases of both physical ailment (as in cardiomyopathy) and psychological conditions (such as psychopathy).[2]  A physician practicing pathology is called a pathologist.

grandiosity,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandiosity,List of personality disorders,"In psychology, grandiosity is a sense of superiority, uniqueness, or invulnerability that is unrealistic and not based on personal capability. It may be expressed by exaggerated beliefs regarding one's abilities, the belief that few other people have anything in common with oneself, and that one can only be understood by a few, very special people.[1] Grandiosity is a core diagnostic criterion for hypomania/mania in bipolar disorder and narcissistic personality disorder.[2]
"
attention-seeking,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention-seeking,List of personality disorders,"Attention seeking behavior is to act in a way that is likely to elicit attention. Attention seeking behavior is defined in the DSM-5 as ""engaging in behavior designed to attract notice and to make oneself the focus of others' attention and admiration"".[1]: 780  This definition does not ascribe a motivation to the behavior and assumes a human actor, although the term ""attention seeking"" sometimes also assumes a motive of seeking validation. People are thought to engage in both positive and negative attention seeking behavior independent of the actual benefit or harm to health. In line with much research and a dynamic self-regulatory processing model of narcissism, motivations for attention seeking are considered to be driven by self-consciousness and thus an externalization of personality rather than internal and self-motivated behavior.[2] Attention seeking is often caused by threats to one's self-concept and the need for social acceptance.[3] This type of influence on behavior can result in a potential loss of a person's sense of agency, personality disorder and the behavior associated with these conditions.

Affect is a fundamental aspect of human experience and plays a central role in many psychological theories and studies. It can be understood as a combination of three components: emotion, mood (enduring, less intense emotional states that are not necessarily tied to a specific event), and affectivity (an individual's overall disposition or temperament, which can be characterized as having a generally positive or negative affect). In psychology, the term affect is often used interchangeably with several related terms and concepts, though each term may have slightly different nuances. These terms encompass: emotion, feeling, mood, emotional state, sentiment, affective state, emotional response, affective reactivity, disposition. Researchers and psychologists may employ specific terms based on their focus and the context of their work.[2]

Personality traits that have been positively linked to this compulsion include assertiveness, willingness to communicate, self-perceived communication competence, and neuroticism.[2] Studies have shown that most people who are talkaholics are aware of the amount of talking they do, but are unable to stop or do not see it as a problem.[3]

In esophageal speech, pressurized air is injected into the upper esophagus and then released in a controlled manner to create the airstream necessary for speech. Esophageal speech is a learned skill that requires speech training and much practice. On average it takes 6 months to a year to learn this form of speech. Because of the high level of difficulty in learning esophageal speech, some patients are unable to master the skill.

Progressive nonfluent aphasia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_nonfluent_aphasia,List of communication disorders,"Progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) is one of three clinical syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. PNFA has an insidious onset of language deficits over time as opposed to other stroke-based aphasias, which occur acutely following trauma to the brain. The specific degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes in PNFA creates hallmark language deficits differentiating this disorder from other Alzheimer-type disorders by the initial absence of other cognitive and memory deficits. This disorder commonly has a primary effect on the left hemisphere, causing the symptomatic display of expressive language deficits (production difficulties) and sometimes may disrupt receptive abilities in comprehending grammatically complex language.[1]
"
Global aphasia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_aphasia,List of communication disorders,"Global aphasia is a severe form of nonfluent aphasia, caused by damage to the left side of the brain, that affects[1] receptive and expressive language skills (needed for both written and oral language) as well as auditory and visual comprehension.[2] Acquired impairments of communicative abilities are present across all language modalities, impacting language production, comprehension, and repetition.[3][1] Patients with global aphasia may be able to verbalize a few short utterances and use non-word neologisms,[4] but their overall production ability is limited.[1] Their ability to repeat words, utterances, or phrases is also affected.[1] Due to the preservation of the right hemisphere, an individual with global aphasia may still be able to express themselves through facial expressions, gestures, and intonation.[3][5][6] This type of aphasia often results from a large lesion of the left perisylvian cortex. The lesion is caused by an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery[4][7] and is associated with damage to Broca's area, Wernicke's area, and insular regions which are associated with aspects of language.[8][9]

Anomic aphasia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomic_aphasia,List of communication disorders,"Anomic aphasia, also known as dysnomia, nominal aphasia, and amnesic aphasia, is a mild, fluent type of aphasia where individuals have word retrieval failures and cannot express the words they want to say (particularly nouns and verbs).[1] By contrast, anomia is a deficit of expressive language, and a symptom of all forms of aphasia, but patients whose primary deficit is word retrieval are diagnosed with anomic aphasia.[2] Individuals with aphasia who display anomia can often describe an object in detail and maybe even use hand gestures to demonstrate how the object is used, but cannot find the appropriate word to name the object.[3] Patients with anomic aphasia have relatively preserved speech fluency, repetition, comprehension, and grammatical speech.
"
Conduction aphasia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conduction_aphasia,List of communication disorders,"Conduction aphasia, also called associative aphasia, is an uncommon form of aphasia caused by damage to the parietal lobe of the brain. An acquired language disorder, it is characterized by intact auditory comprehension, coherent (yet paraphasic) speech production, but poor speech repetition. Affected people are fully capable of understanding what they are hearing, but fail to encode phonological information for production. This deficit is load-sensitive as the person shows significant difficulty repeating phrases, particularly as the phrases increase in length and complexity and as they stumble over words they are attempting to pronounce.[1][2] People have frequent errors during spontaneous speech, such as substituting or transposing sounds. They are also  aware of their errors and will show significant difficulty correcting them.[3]

Receptive aphasia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptive_aphasia,List of communication disorders,"Wernicke's aphasia, also known as receptive aphasia,[1] sensory aphasia, fluent aphasia, or posterior aphasia, is a type of aphasia in which individuals have difficulty understanding written and spoken language.[2] Patients with Wernicke's aphasia demonstrate fluent speech, which is characterized by typical speech rate, intact syntactic abilities and effortless speech output.[3] Writing often reflects speech in that it tends to lack content or meaning. In most cases, motor deficits (i.e. hemiparesis) do not occur in individuals with Wernicke's aphasia.[4] Therefore, they may produce a large amount of speech without much meaning. Individuals with Wernicke's aphasia often suffer of anosognosia – they are unaware of their errors in speech and do not realize their speech may lack meaning.[5] They typically remain unaware of even their most profound language deficits.

The ICD is maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO), which is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations System.[1] The ICD was originally designed as a health care classification system, providing a system of diagnostic codes for classifying diseases, including nuanced classifications of a wide variety of signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or disease. This system is designed to map health conditions to corresponding generic categories together with specific variations; for these designated codes are assigned, each up to six characters long. Thus each major category is designed to include a set of similar diseases.

Deafness,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deafness,List of communication disorders,"Deafness has varying definitions in cultural and medical contexts. In medical contexts, the meaning of deafness is hearing loss that precludes a person from understanding spoken language, an audiological condition.[1] In this context it is written with a lower case d. It later came to be used in a cultural context to refer to those who primarily communicate with a deafness aid or through sign language regardless of hearing ability, often capitalized as Deaf and referred to as ""big D Deaf"" in speech and sign.[2][3] The two definitions overlap but are not identical, as hearing loss includes cases that are not severe enough to impact spoken language comprehension, while cultural Deafness includes hearing people who use sign language, such as children of deaf adults.

These symptoms can be seen in many different psychiatric and mental disorders, which can lead to more specific diagnoses of an individual's condition. However, some of the situations might not fall under specific categories listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Minor depressive disorder is an example of one of these nonspecific diagnoses, as it is a disorder classified in the DSM-IV-TR under the category Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (DD-NOS).[1] The classification of NOS depressive disorders is up for debate. Minor depressive disorder as a term was never an officially accepted term, but was listed in Appendix B of the DSM-IV-TR. This is the only version of the DSM that contains the term, as the prior versions and the most recent edition, DSM-5, do not mention it.[2][3]

Recurrent brief depression,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_brief_depression,List of mood disorders,"Recurrent brief depression (RBD) defines a mental disorder characterized by intermittent depressive episodes, not related to menstrual cycles in women, occurring between approximately 6–12 times per year, over at least one year or more fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for major depressive episodes (DSM-IV and ICD-10) except for duration in which RBD is less than 14 days  (typically 5–7 days).[1] Despite the short duration of the depressive episodes, such episodes are severe, and suicidal ideation and impaired function is rather common. The majority of patients with RBD also report symptoms of anxiety and increased irritability. Hypersomnia is also rather frequent. About 1/2 of patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria for RBD may have additional short episodes of brief hypomania, which is a severity marker of RBD. RBD may be the only mental disorder present, however RBD may also occur as part of a history of recurrent major depressive episodes or bipolar disorders. RBD is also seen among some patients with personality disorders.

Asystole is the most serious form of cardiac arrest and is usually irreversible. Also referred to as cardiac flatline, asystole is the state of total cessation of electrical activity from the heart, which means no tissue contraction from the heart muscle and therefore no blood flow to the rest of the body.

"
defibrillation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defibrillation,List of heart disorders,"Defibrillation is a treatment for life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, specifically ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib) and non-perfusing ventricular tachycardia (V-Tach).[1][2] A defibrillator delivers a dose of electric current (often called a counter-shock) to the heart. Although not fully understood, this process depolarizes a large amount of the heart muscle, ending the arrhythmia. Subsequently, the body's natural pacemaker in the sinoatrial node of the heart is able to re-establish normal sinus rhythm.[3] A heart which is in asystole (flatline) cannot be restarted by a defibrillator; it would be treated only by cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and medication, and then by cardioversion or defibrillation if it converts into a shockable rhythm.

"
Velopharyngeal insufficiency,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velopharyngeal_insufficiency,List of communication disorders,"Velopharyngeal insufficiency  is a disorder of structure that causes a failure of the velum (soft palate) to close against the posterior pharyngeal wall (back wall of the throat) during speech in order to close off the nasal cavity during oral speech production. This is important because speech requires sound from the vocal folds and airflow from the lungs to be directed into the oral cavity (mouth) for the production of all speech sounds, with the exception of nasal consonants (m, n, and ng). If complete closure does not occur during speech, this can cause hypernasality (a resonance disorder) and/or audible nasal emission during speech (a speech sound disorder). In addition, there may be inadequate airflow to produce most consonants, making them sound weak or omitted.[1]

luteal phase,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteal_phase,List of mood disorders,"The menstrual cycle is on average 28 days in length. It begins with menses (day 1–7) during the follicular phase (day 1–14), followed by ovulation (day 14) and ending with the luteal phase (day 14–28).[1] While historically, medical experts believed the luteal phase to be relatively fixed at approximately 14 days (i.e. days 14–28),[1] recent research suggests that there can be wide variability in luteal phase lengths not just from person to person, but from cycle to cycle within one person.[2] The luteal phase is characterized by changes to hormone levels, such as an increase in progesterone and estrogen levels, decrease in gonadotropins such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), changes to the endometrial lining to promote implantation of the fertilized egg, and development of the corpus luteum. In the absence of fertilization by sperm, the corpus luteum degenerates leading to a decrease in progesterone and estrogen, an increase in FSH and LH, and shedding of the endometrial lining (menses) to begin the menstrual cycle again.[1]

interpersonal rejection,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_rejection,List of mood disorders,"Social rejection occurs when an individual is deliberately excluded from a social relationship or social interaction. The topic includes interpersonal rejection (or peer rejection), romantic rejection, and familial estrangement. A person can be rejected or shunned by individuals or an entire group of people. Furthermore, rejection can be either active by bullying, teasing, or ridiculing, or passive by ignoring a person, or giving the ""silent treatment"". The experience of being rejected is subjective for the recipient, and it can be perceived when it is not actually present. The word ""ostracism"" is also commonly used to denote a process of social exclusion (in Ancient Greece, ostracism was a form of temporary banishment following a people's vote).[2]

Those affected primarily exhibit a depressive mood for at least two weeks or more, and a loss of interest or pleasure in everyday activities. Other symptoms can include feelings of emptiness, hopelessness, anxiety, worthlessness, guilt, irritability, changes in appetite, difficulties in concentration, difficulties remembering details, making decisions, and thoughts of suicide.[1] Insomnia or hypersomnia and aches, pains, or digestive problems that are resistant to treatment may also be present.[1]
"
manic,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania,List of mood disorders,"Mania, also known as manic syndrome, is a psychiatric behavioral syndrome[1][2] defined as a state of abnormally elevated arousal, affect, and energy level.[3] During a manic episode, an individual will experience rapidly changing emotions and moods, highly influenced by surrounding stimuli. Although mania is often conceived of as a ""mirror image"" to depression, the heightened mood can be dysphoric as well as euphoric.[4] As the mania intensifies, irritability can be more pronounced and result in anxiety or anger.
"
Sick sinus syndrome,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_sinus_syndrome,List of heart disorders,"Sinus node dysfunction (SND), also known as sick sinus syndrome (SSS), is a group of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) usually caused by a malfunction of the sinus node, the heart's primary pacemaker.[1][2] Tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome is a variant of sick sinus syndrome in which the arrhythmia alternates between fast and slow heart rates.[3]
"
AV node,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV_node,List of heart disorders,"The atrioventricular node (AV node, or Aschoff-Tawara node) electrically connects the heart's atria and ventricles to coordinate beating in the top of the heart; it is part of the electrical conduction system of the heart.[1] The AV node lies at the lower back section of the interatrial septum near the opening of the coronary sinus, and conducts the normal electrical impulse from the atria to the ventricles. The AV node is quite compact (~1 x 3 x 5 mm).[2]
"
bigeminy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigeminy,List of heart disorders,"Bigeminy is a cardiac arrhythmia in which there is a single ectopic beat, or irregular heartbeat, following each regular heartbeat. Most often this is due to ectopic beats occurring so frequently that there is one after each sinus beat, or normal heartbeat. The two beats are figuratively similar to two twins (hence bi- + gemini).  For example, in ventricular bigeminy, a sinus beat is shortly followed by a premature ventricular contraction (PVC), a pause, another normal beat, and then another PVC.[1] In atrial bigeminy, the other ""twin"" is a premature atrial contraction (PAC).
"
Premature ventricular contractions,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_ventricular_contraction,List of heart disorders,"A premature ventricular contraction (PVC) is a common event where the heartbeat is initiated by Purkinje fibers in the ventricles rather than by the sinoatrial node. PVCs may cause no symptoms or may be perceived as a ""skipped beat"" or felt as palpitations in the chest. PVCs do not usually pose any danger.[1]
"
Premature atrial contractions,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premature_atrial_contraction,List of heart disorders,"Premature atrial contraction (PAC), also known as atrial premature complexes (APC) or atrial premature beats (APB), are a common arrhythmia characterized by premature heartbeats originating in the atria. While the sinoatrial node typically regulates the heartbeat during normal sinus rhythm, PACs occur when another region of the atria depolarizes before the sinoatrial node and thus triggers a premature heartbeat,[1] in contrast to escape beats, in which the normal sinoatrial node fails, leaving a non-nodal pacemaker to initiate a late beat. 
"
drug-induced QT prolongation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug-induced_QT_prolongation,List of heart disorders,"QT prolongation is a measure of delayed ventricular repolarisation, which means the heart muscle takes longer than normal to recharge between beats. It is an electrical disturbance which can be seen on an electrocardiogram (EKG). Excessive QT prolongation can trigger tachycardias such as torsades de pointes (TdP). QT prolongation is an established side effect of antiarrhythmics, but can also be caused by a wide range of non-cardiac medicines, including antibiotics, antidepressants, antihistamines, opioids, and complementary medicines. On an EKG, the QT interval represents the summation of action potentials in cardiac muscle cells, which can be caused by an increase in inward current through sodium or calcium channels, or a decrease in outward current through potassium channels. By binding to and inhibiting the “rapid” delayed rectifier potassium current protein, certain drugs are able to decrease the outward flow of potassium ions and extend the length of phase 3 myocardial repolarization, resulting in QT prolongation.

first-degree AV block,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-degree_AV_block,List of heart disorders,"First-degree atrioventricular block (AV block) is a disease of the electrical conduction system of the heart in which electrical impulses conduct from the cardiac atria to the ventricles through the atrioventricular node (AV node) more slowly than normal. First degree AV block does not generally cause any symptoms, but may progress to more severe forms of heart block such as second- and third-degree atrioventricular block. It is diagnosed using an electrocardiogram, and is defined as a PR interval greater than 200 milliseconds.[1] First degree AV block affects 0.65-1.1% of the population with 0.13 new cases per 1000 persons each year.

Long QT syndrome,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_QT_syndrome,List of heart disorders,"Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a condition affecting repolarization (relaxing) of the heart after a heartbeat, giving rise to an abnormally lengthy QT interval.[7] It results in an increased risk of an irregular heartbeat which can result in fainting, drowning, seizures, or sudden death.[1] These episodes can be triggered by exercise or stress.[6] Some rare forms of LQTS are associated with other symptoms and signs including deafness and periods of muscle weakness.[1]
"
Atrial flutter,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_flutter,List of heart disorders,"Atrial flutter (AFL) is a common abnormal heart rhythm that starts in the atrial chambers of the heart.[1]  When it first occurs, it is usually associated with a fast heart rate and is classified as a type of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).[2] Atrial flutter is characterized by a sudden-onset (usually) regular abnormal heart rhythm on an electrocardiogram (ECG) in which the heart rate is fast. Symptoms may include a feeling of the heart beating too fast, too hard, or skipping beats, chest discomfort, difficulty breathing, a feeling as if one's stomach has dropped, a feeling of being light-headed, or loss of consciousness.
"
ventricular fibrillation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_fibrillation,List of heart disorders,"Ventricular fibrillation (V-fib or VF) is an abnormal heart rhythm in which the ventricles of the heart quiver.[2] It is due to disorganized electrical activity.[2] Ventricular fibrillation results in cardiac arrest with loss of consciousness and no pulse.[1] This is followed by sudden cardiac death in the absence of treatment.[2] Ventricular fibrillation is initially found in about 10% of people with cardiac arrest.[1]

coarctation of aorta,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarctation_of_aorta,List of heart disorders,"Coarctation of the aorta (CoA)[1][2] is a congenital condition whereby the aorta is narrow, usually in the area where the ductus arteriosus (ligamentum arteriosum after regression) inserts. The word coarctation means ""pressing or drawing together; narrowing"". Coarctations are most common in the aortic arch. The arch may be small in babies with coarctations. Other heart defects may also occur when coarctation is present, typically occurring on the left side of the heart. When a patient has a coarctation, the left ventricle has to work harder. Since the aorta is narrowed, the left ventricle must generate a much higher pressure than normal in order to force enough blood through the aorta to deliver blood to the lower part of the body. If the narrowing is severe enough, the left ventricle may not be strong enough to push blood through the coarctation, thus resulting in a lack of blood to the lower half of the body. Physiologically its complete form is manifested as interrupted aortic arch.[citation needed]
"
aortic stenosis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_stenosis,List of heart disorders,"Aortic stenosis (AS or AoS) is the narrowing  of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the aorta begins), such that problems result.[1] It may occur at the aortic valve as well as above and below this level.[1] It typically gets worse over time.[1] Symptoms often come on gradually with a decreased ability to exercise often occurring first.[1] If heart failure, loss of consciousness, or heart related chest pain occur due to AS the outcomes are worse.[1] Loss of consciousness typically occurs with standing or exercising.[1] Signs of heart failure include shortness of breath especially when lying down, at night, or with exercise, and swelling of the legs.[1] Thickening of the valve without causing obstruction is known as aortic sclerosis.[1]

"
Blood pressure,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure,List of heart disorders,"Blood pressure (BP) is the pressure of circulating blood against the walls of blood vessels. Most of this pressure results from the heart pumping blood through the circulatory system. When used without qualification, the term ""blood pressure"" refers to the pressure in a brachial artery, where it is most commonly measured. Blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic pressure (maximum pressure during one heartbeat) over diastolic pressure (minimum pressure between two heartbeats) in the cardiac cycle. It is measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg) above the surrounding atmospheric pressure, or in kilopascals (kPa). The difference between the systolic and diastolic pressures is known as pulse pressure,[1] while the average pressure during a cardiac cycle is known as mean arterial pressure.[2]

Pulses,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse,List of heart disorders,"In medicine, the pulse refers to the rhythmic pulsations (expansion and contraction) of an artery in response to the cardiac cycle (heartbeat).[1] The pulse may be felt (palpated) in any place that allows an artery to be compressed near the surface of the body close to the skin, such as at the neck (carotid artery), wrist (radial artery or ulnar artery), at the groin (femoral artery), behind the knee (popliteal artery), near the ankle joint (posterior tibial artery), and on foot (dorsalis pedis artery).[2][1] The pulse is most commonly measured at the wrist or neck for adults[3] and at the brachial artery (inner upper arm between the shoulder and elbow) for infants and very young children.[4] A sphygmograph is an instrument for measuring the pulse.[5]

cotton wool spots,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_wool_spots,List of heart disorders,"Cotton wool spots are opaque fluffy white patches on the retina of the eye that are considered an abnormal finding during a funduscopic exam (also called an ophthalmoscopic exam).[1] Cotton wool spots are typically a sign of another disease state, most common of which is diabetic retinopathy.[2] The irregularly shaped white patches are a result of ischemia, or reduced blood flow and oxygen, in the retinal nerve fiber layer, which is located in the distribution of the capillaries of the superficial layer of the retina.[2] These areas with reduced blood flow reflect the obstruction of axoplasmic flow due to mechanical or vascular causes and the consequential accumulation as a result of decreased axonal transport.[1][2] This reduced axonal transport can then cause swelling or bulging on the surface layer of the retina, increasing the potential for nerve fiber damage.[2]

Apex beat,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_beat,List of heart disorders,"
The apex beat (lat. ictus cordis), also called the apical impulse,[1] is the pulse felt at the point of maximum impulse (PMI), which is the point on the precordium farthest outwards (laterally) and downwards (inferiorly) from the sternum at which the cardiac impulse can be felt. The cardiac impulse is the vibration resulting from the heart rotating, moving forward, and striking against the chest wall during systole. The PMI is not the apex of the heart but is on the precordium not far from it. Another theory for the occurrence of the PMI is the early systolic contraction of the longitudinal fibers of the left ventricle located on the endocardial surface of this chamber. This period of the cardiac cycle is called isovolumic contraction. Because the contraction starts near the base of the left ventricle and spreads toward the apex most of the longitudinal fibers of the left ventricle have shortened before the apex. The rapidly increasing pressure developed by the shortening of these fibers causes the aortic valve to open and the apex to move outward causing the PMI. Anatomical dissection of the musculature of the apex reveals that muscle fibers are no longer longitudinal oriented but form a spiral mass of muscular tissues which may also have an effect on the ability of the apex to contract longitudinally. After the longitudinal fibers contract, the ejection of blood out of the left ventricle is accomplished by the torsional (as one would wring out a face cloth) action of the circumferential muscle fibers of the left ventricle that are in the mid-portion of the ventricle and contract after the longitudinal fibers. During the longitudinal fiber contraction, the volume of the left ventricle has not changed keeping the apex in intimate contact with the chest wall allowing the ability to feel the apex move outward before the heart empties greater than 55% of its volume and the apex falling away from the chest wall.

Tethered spinal cord syndrome,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethered_spinal_cord_syndrome,List of neurological conditions and disorders,"Tethered cord syndrome (TCS) refers to a group of neurological disorders that relate to malformations of the spinal cord.[1] Various forms include tight filum terminale, lipomeningomyelocele, split cord malformations (diastematomyelia), occult, dermal sinus tracts, and dermoids.
All forms involve the pulling of the spinal cord at the base of the spinal canal, literally a tethered cord.[1] The spinal cord normally hangs loose in the canal, free to move up and down with growth, and with bending and stretching. A tethered cord, however, is held taut at the end or at some point in the spinal canal. In children, a tethered cord can force the spinal cord to stretch as they grow. In adults the spinal cord stretches in the course of normal activity, usually leading to progressive spinal cord damage if untreated.[1] TCS is often associated with the closure of a spina bifida. It can be congenital, such as in tight filum terminale, or the result of injury later in life.[2][3]

The type of food consumed does not appear to affect its occurrence. It is reported, based on a preliminary study, to be passed along genetically as an autosomal dominant trait, as first described by Ahmad Teebi and Qasem Al-Saleh in 1989.[1] The term ""snatiation"", coined shortly thereafter in a humorous letter to the Journal of Medical Genetics by Judith G. Hall, is a portmanteau of the words sneeze and satiation.[2] Similar in nature to this condition is gustatory rhinitis, which involves rhinorrhea induced by certain foods, such as spicy foods.[3]

REM sleep behavior disorder,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REM_sleep_behavior_disorder,List of neurological conditions and disorders,"Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder or REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a sleep disorder in which people act out their dreams.  It involves abnormal behavior during the sleep phase with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The major feature of RBD is loss of muscle atonia (i.e., the loss of paralysis) during otherwise intact REM sleep (during which paralysis is not only normal but necessary). The loss of motor inhibition leads to sleep behaviors ranging from simple limb twitches to more complex integrated movements that can be violent or result in injury to either the individual or their bedmates.[1][2]

Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsay_Hunt_syndrome_type_II,List of neurological conditions and disorders,"Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2, commonly referred to simply as Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS) and also known as herpes zoster oticus, is inflammation of the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve as a late consequence of varicella zoster virus (VZV). In regard to the frequency, less than 1% of varicella zoster infections involve the facial nerve and result in RHS.[1] It is traditionally defined as a triad of ipsilateral facial paralysis, otalgia, and vesicles close to the ear and auditory canal. Due to its proximity to the vestibulocochlear nerve, the virus can spread and cause hearing loss, tinnitus (hearing noises that are not caused by outside sounds), and vertigo. It is common for diagnoses to be overlooked or delayed, which can raise the likelihood of long-term consequences. It is more complicated than Bell's palsy. Therapy aims to shorten its overall length, while also providing pain relief and averting any consequences.

Rhythmic movement disorder,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythmic_movement_disorder,List of neurological conditions and disorders,"Rhythmic movement disorder (RMD) is a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive movements of large muscle groups immediately before and during sleep often involving the head and neck. It was independently described first in 1905 by Zappert as jactatio capitis nocturna and by Cruchet as rhythmie du sommeil.[1] The majority of RMD episodes occur during NREM sleep, although REM movements have been reported. RMD is often associated with other psychiatric conditions or mental disabilities. The disorder often leads to bodily injury from unwanted movements. Because of these incessant muscle contractions, patients' sleep patterns are often disrupted. It differs from restless legs syndrome in that RMD involves involuntary muscle contractions before and during sleep while restless legs syndrome is the urge to move before sleep. RMD occurs in both males and females, often during early childhood with symptoms diminishing with age. Many affected individuals also have other sleep related disorders, like sleep apnea. The disorder can be differentially diagnosed into small subcategories, including sleep related bruxism, thumb sucking, hypnagogic foot tremor, and rhythmic sucking, to name a few.[2] In order to be considered pathological, the ICSD-II requires that in the sleep-related rhythmic movements should “markedly interfere with normal sleep, cause significant impairment in daytime function, or result in self-inflicted bodily injury that requires medical treatment (or would result in injury if preventive measures were not used)”.[3]

Primary orthostatic hypotension is also often referred to as neurogenic orthostatic hypotension.[3] The drop in blood pressure may be sudden (vasovagal orthostatic hypotension), within 3 minutes (classic orthostatic hypotension) or gradual (delayed orthostatic hypotension).[4] It is defined as a fall in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg after 3 minutes of standing. It occurs predominantly by delayed (or absent) constriction of the lower body blood vessels, which is normally required to maintain adequate blood pressure when changing the position to standing. As a result, blood pools in the blood vessels of the legs for a longer period, and less is returned to the heart, thereby leading to a reduced cardiac output and inadequate blood flow to the brain.

Occult spinal dysraphism sequence,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult_spinal_dysraphism_sequence,List of neurological conditions and disorders,"Tethered cord syndrome (TCS) refers to a group of neurological disorders that relate to malformations of the spinal cord.[1] Various forms include tight filum terminale, lipomeningomyelocele, split cord malformations (diastematomyelia), occult, dermal sinus tracts, and dermoids.
All forms involve the pulling of the spinal cord at the base of the spinal canal, literally a tethered cord.[1] The spinal cord normally hangs loose in the canal, free to move up and down with growth, and with bending and stretching. A tethered cord, however, is held taut at the end or at some point in the spinal canal. In children, a tethered cord can force the spinal cord to stretch as they grow. In adults the spinal cord stretches in the course of normal activity, usually leading to progressive spinal cord damage if untreated.[1] TCS is often associated with the closure of a spina bifida. It can be congenital, such as in tight filum terminale, or the result of injury later in life.[2][3]

Macropsia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macropsia,List of neurological conditions and disorders,"Macropsia is a neurological condition affecting human visual perception, in which objects within an affected section of the visual field appear larger than normal, causing the person to feel smaller than they actually are. Macropsia, along with its opposite condition, micropsia, can be categorized under dysmetropsia. Macropsia is related to other conditions dealing with visual perception, such as aniseikonia and Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS, also known as Todd's syndrome).  Macropsia has a wide range of causes, from prescription and illicit drugs, to migraines and (rarely) complex partial epilepsy, and to different retinal conditions, such as epiretinal membrane.[1] Physiologically, retinal macropsia results from the compression of cones in the eye. It is the compression of receptor distribution that results in greater stimulation and thus a larger perceived image of an object.

The practice was enthusiastically taken up in the United States by the neuropsychiatrist Walter Freeman and the neurosurgeon James W. Watts who devised what became the standard prefrontal procedure and named their operative technique lobotomy, although the operation was called leucotomy in the United Kingdom.[4] In spite of the award of the Nobel Prize to Moniz in 1949, the use of psychosurgery declined during the 1950s. By the 1970s the standard Freeman-Watts type of operation was very rare, but other forms of psychosurgery, although used on a much smaller scale, survived. Some countries have abandoned psychosurgery altogether; in others, for example the US and the UK, it is only used in a few centres on small numbers of people with depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).[5]
In some countries it is also used in the treatment of schizophrenia and other disorders.[6][7]

Psychiatric epidemiology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_epidemiology,List of mental disorders,"Psychiatric epidemiology is a field which studies the causes (etiology) of mental disorders in society, as well as conceptualization and prevalence of mental illness. It is a subfield of the more general epidemiology. It has roots in sociological studies of the early 20th century. However, while sociological exposures are still widely studied in psychiatric epidemiology, the field has since expanded to the study of a wide area of environmental risk factors, such as major life events, as well as genetic exposures. Increasingly neuroscientific techniques like MRI are used to explore the mechanisms behind how exposures to risk factors may impact psychological problems and explore the neuroanatomical substrate underlying psychiatric disorders.[1]: 6 
"
Philosophy of psychiatry,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_psychiatry,List of mental disorders,"The philosophy of psychiatry explores philosophical questions relating to psychiatry and mental illness. The philosopher of science and medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy of psychiatry.

The symptoms are a result of dysfunction of  long axons in the spinal cord. The affected cells are the primary motor neurons; therefore, the disease is an upper motor neuron disease.[2] HSP is not a form of cerebral palsy even though it physically may appear and behave much the same as spastic diplegia. The origin of HSP  is different from cerebral palsy. Despite this, some of the same anti-spasticity medications used in spastic cerebral palsy are sometimes used to  treat HSP symptoms.

Diabetic neuropathy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_neuropathy,List of neurological conditions and disorders,"Diabetic neuropathy includes various types of nerve damage associated with diabetes mellitus. The most common form, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, affects 30% of all diabetic patients.[1][2] Studies suggests that cutaneous nerve branches, such as the sural nerve, are involved in more than half of patients with diabetes 10 years after the diagnosis and can be detected with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging.[3] Symptoms depend on the site of nerve damage and can include motor changes such as weakness; sensory symptoms such as numbness, tingling, or pain; or autonomic changes such as urinary symptoms. These changes are thought to result from a microvascular injury involving small blood vessels that supply nerves (vasa nervorum).  Relatively common conditions which may be associated with diabetic neuropathy include distal symmetric polyneuropathy; third, fourth, or sixth cranial nerve palsy;[4] mononeuropathy; mononeuropathy multiplex; diabetic amyotrophy; and autonomic neuropathy.

Disc herniation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_herniation,List of neurological conditions and disorders,"A disc herniation or spinal disc herniation is an injury to the intervertebral disc between two vertebrae, usually caused by excessive strain or trauma to the spine. It may result in back pain, pain or sensation in different parts of the body, and physical disability. The most conclusive diagnostic tool for disc herniation is MRI, and treatments may range from painkillers to surgery. Protection from disc herniation is best provided by core strength and an awareness of body mechanics including good posture.[1]

Cyclic vomiting syndrome,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_vomiting_syndrome,List of neurological conditions and disorders,"Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a chronic functional condition of unknown pathogenesis. CVS is characterized as recurring episodes lasting a single day to multiple weeks. Each episode is divided into four phases: inter-episodic, prodrome, vomiting, and recovery. During the inter-episodic phase, which typically lasts one week to one month, there are no discernible symptoms and normal activities can occur. The prodrome phase is known as the pre-emetic phase, characterized by the initial feeling of an approaching episode but still being able to keep down oral medication. The emetic or vomiting phase is characterized by intense persistent nausea and repeated vomiting, typically lasting hours to days. During the recovery phase, vomiting ceases, nausea diminishes or is absent, and appetite returns. ""Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a rare abnormality of the neuroendocrine system that affects 2% of children.""[1] This disorder is thought to be closely related to migraines and family history of migraines.[2][3]

Affected individuals often have shorter lower limbs relative to the trunk and upper limbs. The condition is a result of a loss of anterior horn cells localized to lumbar and cervical regions of the spinal cord early in infancy, which in turn is caused by a mutation of the TRPV4 gene. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.[1] Arm muscle and function, as well as cardiac and respiratory functions are typically well preserved.[2]

Most people with Möbius syndrome are born with complete facial paralysis and cannot close their eyes or form facial expressions. Limb and chest wall abnormalities sometimes occur with the syndrome. People with Möbius syndrome have normal intelligence, although their lack of facial expression is sometimes incorrectly taken to be due to dullness or unfriendliness. It is named for Paul Julius Möbius, a German neurologist who first described the syndrome in 1888.[1] In 1994, the ""Moebius Syndrome Foundation"" was founded, and later that year the first ""Moebius Syndrome Foundation Conference"" was held in Los Angeles.[2]

Compression neuropathy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_neuropathy,List of neurological conditions and disorders,"Nerve compression syndrome, or compression neuropathy,  or nerve entrapment syndrome, is a medical condition caused by chronic, direct pressure on a peripheral nerve.[1] It is known colloquially as a trapped nerve, though this may also refer to nerve root compression (by a herniated disc, for example). Its symptoms include pain, tingling, numbness and muscle weakness. The symptoms affect just one particular part of the body, depending on which nerve is affected. The diagnosis is largely clinical and can be confirmed with diagnostic nerve blocks. Occasionally imaging and electrophysiology studies aid in the diagnosis. Timely diagnosis is important as untreated chronic nerve compression may cause permanent damage. A surgical nerve decompression can relieve pressure on the nerve but cannot always reverse the physiological changes that occurred before treatment. Nerve injury by a single episode of physical trauma is in one sense an acute compression neuropathy but is not usually included under this heading, as chronic compression takes a unique pathophysiological course.

Delusional misidentification syndrome,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusional_misidentification_syndrome,List of mental disorders,"Delusional misidentification syndrome is an umbrella term, introduced by Christodoulou (in his book The Delusional Misidentification Syndromes, Karger, Basel, 1986) for a group of four delusional disorders that occur in the context of mental and neurological illness. They are grouped together as they often occur simultaneously or interchange, and they display the common concept of the double (sosie).[1] They all involve a belief that the identity of a person, object, or place has somehow changed or has been altered. Christodoulu further categorized these disorders into those including hypo (or under)-identification of a well-known person (Capgras delusion), and hyper (or over)-identification of an unknown person (the remaining three).[2] As these delusions typically only concern one particular topic, they also fall under the category called monothematic delusions.[3]

"
Conduct disorder,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conduct_disorder,List of mental disorders,"Conduct disorder (CD) is a mental disorder diagnosed in childhood or adolescence that presents itself through a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior that includes theft, lies, physical violence that may lead to destruction, and reckless breaking of rules,[2] in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate norms are violated. These behaviors are often referred to as ""antisocial behaviors"",[3] and is often seen as the precursor to antisocial personality disorder; however, the latter, by definition, cannot be diagnosed until the individual is 18 years old.[4]  Conduct disorder may result from parental rejection and neglect and in such cases can be treated with family therapy, as well as behavioral modifications and pharmacotherapy.[5] It may also be caused by environmental lead exposure.[6] Conduct disorder is estimated to affect 51.1 million people globally as of 2013.[update][7]

Diabulimia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabulimia,List of mental disorders,"Diabulimia (a portmanteau of diabetes and bulimia), also known as ED-DMT1 (eating disorder-diabetes mellitus type 1) in the US or T1ED (type 1 eating disorder) in the UK, is an eating disorder in which people with type 1 diabetes deliberately give themselves less insulin than they need or stop taking it altogether for the purpose of weight loss. Diabulimia is not recognized as a formal psychiatric diagnosis in the DSM-5. Because of this, some in the medical or psychiatric communities use the phrases ""disturbed eating behavior"" or ""disordered eating behavior"" (DEB in both cases) and disordered eating (DE) are quite common in medical and psychiatric literature addressing patients who have type 1 diabetes and manipulate insulin doses to control weight along with exhibiting bulimic behavior.

"
Intermittent explosive disorder,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_explosive_disorder,List of mental disorders,"Intermittent explosive disorder (IED), or episodic dyscontrol syndrome (EDS), is a mental disorder characterized by explosive outbursts of anger or violence, often to the point of rage, that are disproportionate to the situation (e.g., impulsive shouting, screaming, or excessive reprimanding triggered by relatively inconsequential events). Impulsive aggression is not premeditated, and is defined by a disproportionate reaction to any provocation, real or perceived, that would often be associated with a choleric temperament.

In females, the pain can primarily be on the external surface of the genitalia, or deeper in the pelvis upon deep pressure against the cervix. Medically, dyspareunia is a pelvic floor dysfunction and is frequently underdiagnosed.[2] It can affect a small portion of the vulva or vagina or be felt all over the surface. Understanding the duration, location, and nature of the pain is important in identifying the causes of the pain.

Alternating hemiplegia of childhood,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_hemiplegia_of_childhood,List of neurological conditions and disorders,"Alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) is a rare neurological disorder named for the transient episodes, often referred to as ""attacks"", of hemiplegia (weakness or paralysis) that those with the condition experience. It typically presents before the age of 18 months. These hemiplegic attacks can cause anything from mild weakness to complete paralysis on one or both sides of the body, and they can vary greatly in duration. Attacks may also alternate from one side of the body to the other, or alternate between affecting one or both sides during a single attack. Besides hemiplegia, symptoms of the disorder include an extremely broad range of neurological and developmental impairments which are not well understood. Normally, hemiplegia and other associated symptoms cease completely with sleep, but they may recur upon waking.[1]

Symptoms include mental and physical developmental delays, followed by the loss of developmental milestones, an abnormal increase in head size and seizures. The juvenile form of Alexander disease has an onset between the ages of 2 and 13 years. These children may have excessive vomiting, difficulty swallowing and speaking, poor coordination, and loss of motor control. Adult-onset forms of Alexander disease are less common. The symptoms sometimes mimic those of Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis, or may present primarily as a psychiatric disorder.

Abulia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abulia,List of neurological conditions and disorders,"In neurology, abulia, or aboulia (from Ancient Greek: βουλή, meaning ""will""),[1] refers to a lack of will or initiative and can be seen as a disorder of diminished motivation. Abulia falls in the middle of the spectrum of diminished motivation, with apathy being less extreme and akinetic mutism being more extreme than abulia.[2] The condition was originally considered to be a disorder of the will,[3][4] and aboulic individuals are unable to act or make decisions independently; and their condition may range in severity from subtle to overwhelming. In the case of akinetic mutism, many patients describe that as soon as they ""will"" or attempt a movement, a ""counter-will"" or ""resistance"" rises up to meet them.[5]

Not all medically unexplained symptoms are influenced by identifiable psychological factors.[2]  However, in practice, most physicians and authors who use the term consider that the symptoms most likely arise from psychological causes. Typically, the possibility that MUPS are caused by prescription drugs or other drugs is ignored.[3]

Addictive personality,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addictive_personality,List of mental disorders,"An addictive personality refers to a hypothesized set of personality traits that make an individual predisposed to developing addictions. This hypothesis states that there may be common personality traits observable in people suffering from addiction; however, the lack of a universally agreed upon definition has marked the research surrounding addictive personality. Addiction is a fairly broad term; it is most often associated with substance use disorders, but it can also be extended to cover a number of other compulsive behaviors, including sex, internet, television, gambling, food, and shopping. Within these categories of addiction a common diagnostic scale involves tolerance, withdrawal, and cravings.[1] This is a fairly contentious topic, with many experts suggesting the term be retired due to a lack of cumulative evidence supporting the existence of addictive personality.[2] It has been claimed that characteristics of personality attributed to addictive personality do not predict addiction, but rather can be the result of addiction.[3] However, different personality traits have been linked to various types of addictive behaviors, suggesting that individual addictions may be associated with different personality profiles.[4] The strongest consensus is that genetic factors play the largest role in determining a predisposition for addictive behaviors.[5] Even then, however, genes play different roles in different types of addictions. Forty to seventy percent of the population variance in the expression of addictions can be explained by genetic factors.[6]

Harmful pattern of use of caffeine,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine_dependence,List of mental disorders,"Caffeine dependence is a condition characterized by a set of criteria, including tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to control use, and continued use despite knowledge of adverse consequences attributed to caffeine.[1] It can appear in physical dependence or psychological dependence, or both. Caffeine is one of the most common additives in many consumer products, including pills and beverages such as caffeinated alcoholic beverages, energy drinks, pain reliever medications, and colas. Caffeine is found naturally in various plants such as coffee and tea. Studies have found that 89 percent of adults in the U.S. consume on average 200 mg of caffeine daily.[2] One area of concern that has been presented is the relationship between pregnancy and caffeine consumption. Repeated caffeine doses of 100 mg appeared to result in smaller size at birth in newborns. When looking at birth weight however, caffeine consumption did not appear to make an impact.[3]

All opioids, both recreational drugs and medications, when reduced or stopped, can lead to opioid withdrawal symptoms. When withdrawal symptoms are due to recreational opioid use, the term opioid use disorder is used, whereas when due to prescribed medications, the term prescription opioid use disorder is used.[3]  Opioid withdrawal can be managed by the use of opioid replacement therapy, while symptoms may be relieved by the use of medications such as lofexidine and clonidine.[4]

It is a syndrome of progressive deterioration of memory, cognition, behavior, and motor function in HIV-infected individuals during the late stages of the disease, when immunodeficiency is severe.[1] HAND may include neurological disorders of various severity. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders are associated with a metabolic encephalopathy induced by HIV infection and fueled by immune activation of macrophages and microglia.[2] These cells are actively infected with HIV and secrete neurotoxins of both host and viral origin. The essential features of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) are disabling cognitive impairment accompanied by motor dysfunction, speech problems and behavioral change.[3] Cognitive impairment is characterised by mental slowness, trouble with memory and poor concentration. Motor symptoms include a loss of fine motor control leading to clumsiness, poor balance and tremors. Behavioral changes may include apathy, lethargy and diminished emotional responses and spontaneity. Histopathologically, it is identified by the infiltration of monocytes and macrophages into the central nervous system (CNS), gliosis, pallor of myelin sheaths, abnormalities of dendritic processes and neuronal loss.[2][4]

In 2011, the U.K. National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health similarly concluded that first-time abortion in the first trimester does not increase the risk of mental-health problems compared with bringing the pregnancy to term.[3][6] In 2018, The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that abortion does not lead to depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder.[1] The U.K. Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists likewise summarized the evidence by finding that abortion did not increase the risk of mental-health problems compared to women carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term.[7] Two studies conducted on the Danish population in 2011 and 2012 analysed the association between abortion and psychiatric admission found no increase in admissions after an abortion. The same study, in fact, found an increase in psychiatric admission after first child-birth.[8] A 2008 systematic review of the medical literature on abortion and mental health found that high-quality studies consistently showed few or no mental-health consequences of abortion, while poor-quality studies were more likely to report negative consequences.[9]

Historical critiques of psychiatry came to light after focus on the extreme harms associated with electroconvulsive therapy and insulin shock therapy.[4] The term ""anti-psychiatry"" is in dispute and often used to dismiss all critics of psychiatry, many of whom agree that a specialized role of helper for people in emotional distress may at times be appropriate, and allow for individual choice around treatment decisions.

Mental health often viewed as an adult issue, but in fact, almost half of adolescents in the United States are affected by mental disorders, and about 20% of these are categorized as “severe.”[1] Mental health issues can pose a huge problem for students in terms of academic and social success in school.[2] Education systems around the world treat this topic differently, both directly through official policies and indirectly through cultural views on mental health and well-being. These curriculums are in place to effectively identify mental health disorders and treat it using therapy, medication, or other tools of alleviation. Students' mental health and well-being is very much supported by schools. Schools try to promote mental health awareness and resources. Schools can help these students with interventions, support groups, and therapies. These resources can help reduce the negative impact on mental health. Schools can create mandatory classes based on mental health that can help them see signs of mental health disorders.[2]

Laryngectomy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngectomy,List of voice disorders,"Laryngectomy is the removal of the larynx. In a total laryngectomy, the entire larynx is removed (including the vocal folds, hyoid bone, epiglottis, thyroid and cricoid cartilage and a few tracheal cartilage rings) with the separation of the airway from the mouth, nose and esophagus.[1] In a partial laryngectomy, only a portion of the larynx is removed. Following the procedure, the person breathes through an opening in the neck known as a stoma.[2] This procedure is usually performed by an ENT surgeon in cases of laryngeal cancer. Many cases of laryngeal cancer are treated with more conservative methods (surgeries through the mouth, radiation and/or chemotherapy). A laryngectomy is performed when these treatments fail to conserve the larynx or when the cancer has progressed such that normal functioning would be prevented. Laryngectomies are also performed on individuals with other types of head and neck cancer.[3] Less invasive partial laryngectomies, including tracheal shaves and feminization laryngoplasty may also be performed on transgender women and other female or non-binary identified individuals to feminize the larynx and/or voice.  Post-laryngectomy rehabilitation includes voice restoration, oral feeding and more recently, smell and taste rehabilitation. An individual's quality of life can be  affected post-surgery.[1] People who are laryngectomized are vocal amputees.

To date, more than a million individuals have had KBD.[2] The symptoms of KBD include joint pain, morning stiffness in the joints, disturbances of flexion and extension in the elbows, enlarged inter-phalangeal joints, and limited motion in many joints of the body.[3] Death of cartilage cells in the growth plate and articular surface is the basic pathologic feature; this can result in growth retardation and secondary osteoarthrosis.[1] Histological diagnosis of KBD is particularly difficult; clinical and radiological examinations have proved to be the best means for identifying KBD.[4] Little is known about the early stages of KBD before the visible appearance of the disease becomes evident in the destruction of the joints.[4]

The affected gene, known as lamin A (LMNA), makes a protein necessary for holding the cell nucleus together. When this gene mutates, an abnormal form of lamin A protein called progerin is produced. Progeroid syndromes are a group of diseases that cause individuals to age faster than usual, leading to them appearing older than they actually are. People born with progeria typically live until their mid- to late-teens or early twenties.[9][10] Severe cardiovascular complications usually develop by puberty, later on resulting in death.

It is characterized by having high levels of a circulating antibody, immunoglobulin M (IgM), which is made and secreted by the cells involved in the disease. Waldenström macroglobulinemia is an ""indolent lymphoma"" (i.e., one that tends to grow and spread slowly) and a type of lymphoproliferative disease which shares clinical characteristics with the indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas.[4] It is commonly classified as a form of plasma cell dyscrasia, similar to other plasma cell dyscrasias that, for example, lead to multiple myeloma. Waldenström macroglobulinemia is commonly preceded by two clinically asymptomatic but progressively more pre-malignant phases, IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smoldering Waldenström macroglobulinemia. The Waldenström macroglobulinemia spectrum of dysplasias differs from other spectrums of plasma cell dyscrasias in that it involves not only aberrant plasma cells but also aberrant lymphoplasmacytoid cells and that it involves IgM while other plasma dyscrasias involve other antibody isoforms.[5][6]

It is known to affect several breeds of dogs as well as humans. The three forms of VWD are hereditary, acquired, and pseudo or platelet type. The three types of hereditary VWD are VWD type 1, VWD type 2, and VWD type 3. Type 2 contains various subtypes.[2] Platelet type VWD is also an inherited condition.[3]

Sheehan's syndrome,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheehan%27s_syndrome,List of eponymous diseases,"Sheehan's syndrome, also known as postpartum pituitary gland necrosis, occurs when the pituitary gland is damaged due to significant blood loss and hypovolemic shock (ischemic necrosis) or stroke, originally described during or after childbirth leading to decreased functioning of the pituitary gland (hypopituitarism).[1] Classically, in the milder partial form, the mother is unable to breastfeed her baby, due to failure of the pituitary to secrete the hormone prolactin, and also has no more periods, because FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) and LH (Luteinising Hormone) are not secreted. Although postmenopausal, the mother with this milder form of Sheehan's syndrome does not experience hot flushes, because the pituitary fails to secrete FSH (high levels of FSH, secreted by the pituitary in healthy postmenopausal women is an attempt to trigger ovulation, and these high levels of FSH cause hot the flushes). The failure to breastfeed and amenorrhea no more periods, were seen as the syndrome (a collection of symptoms), but we now view Sheehan's as the pituitary failing to secrete 1-5 of the 9 hormones that it normally produces (the anterior (front) lobe of the pituitary produces FSH, LH, prolactin, ACTH (Adreno-cortico-trophic hormone),TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) and GH (Growth Hormone); the posterior (the lobe at the back) pituitary produces ADH (Anti-Diuretic Hormone) and Oxytocin, i.e. the pituitary is involved in the regulation of many hormones. It is very important to recognise Sheehan' stroke as, the ACTH deficiency Sheehan's in the presence of the stress of a bacterial infection, such as a urine infection, will result in death of the mother from Addisonian crisis.[2][3] This gland is located on the under-surface of the brain, the shape of a cherry and the size of a chickpea and sits in a pit or depression of the sphenoid bone known as the sella turcica (the Turk's saddle).[4] The pituitary gland works in conjunction with the hypothalamus, and other endocrine organs to modulate numerous bodily functions including growth, metabolism, menstruation, lactation, and even the ""fight-or-flight"" response.[3] These endocrine organs, (like the thyroid gland in the neck, or adrenals on the upper pole of the kidneys), release hormones in very specific pathways, known as hormonal axes. For example, the release of a hormone in the hypothalamus will target the pituitary to trigger the release thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and the pituitary's released hormone (TSH) will target the next organ in the pathway i.e. the thyroid to release thyroxin.[3] Hence, damage to the pituitary gland can have downstream effects on any of the aforementioned bodily functions.

It may occur as a single event or subsequent bouts may cause further spread. It is most common in males.[2]: 829  It is named after Jay Frank Schamberg, who described it in 1901. There is no known cure for this disease but it is not a life-threatening condition and is mainly of cosmetic concern, although, because it can appear so suddenly, so extensively and because it usually leaves permanent discoloration of the skin, it can cause understandable psychological concern. The skin lesions sometimes cause itching, which can be treated by applying cortisone cream.  The cortisone cream will only help with the itching and does not improve the discoloration of the skin. Schamberg's disease causes no other symptoms beside skin discoloration and itching. The condition is caused by inflammation of capillaries near the surface of skin and subsequent leaking of red blood cells into surrounding tissues. As the red blood cells break down and get mostly resorbed, some of the iron released by the red blood cells remains in the skin and causes the characteristic rust-colored appearance. The cause of the capillary inflammation is usually unknown.

An estimated 25% of fetuses get infected with varicella infection when mother has a varicella infection during the pregnancy but the risk of developing congenital varicella syndrome is around 2%, therefore majority of the outcomes are normal newborns. Patients with primary infection before 20 weeks of gestation are at a higher risk of developing the severe form of infection, affecting the eyes, limbs, skin and the central nervous system. Diagnosis requires a documented history of primary infection in the mother and serial ultrasound demonstrating features suggestive of congenital varicella syndrome. There is no definitive treatment, termination of pregnancy in fetuses with severe features is recommended.

Müllerian agenesis (including absence of the uterus, cervix and/or vagina) is the cause in 15% of cases of primary amenorrhoea.[2] Because most of the vagina does not develop from the Müllerian duct, instead developing from the urogenital sinus, along with the bladder and urethra, it is present even when the Müllerian duct is completely absent. Because ovaries do not develop from the Müllerian ducts, affected people might have normal secondary sexual characteristics but are infertile due to the lack of a functional uterus.

Condylomata lata occurs in about one-third of secondary syphilis patients and is characterized by painless, mucosal, and warty erosions which  are flat, velvety, moist and broad base in nature. They tend to develop in warm, moist sites of the genitals and perineum.  These lesions hold a high accumulation of spirochetes and are highly infectious. Complete resolution of the lesions is spontaneous and occurs after a few days to many weeks, where it is either resolved completely or enters the tertiary phase, defined by a latent state.[3]

SDH plays a key role in metabolism; the catalytic end, made up of SDHA and SDHB oxidizes succinate to fumarate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The electrons from this reaction then reduce FAD to FADH2, which ultimately reduces ubiquinone to ubiquinol in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. As of 2020, about 61 cases have been reported with genetic studies,[1] but there are also documented cases of CII deficiencies as determined by biochemical and histological analysis without genetic studies.

Together with the related condition lymphocytic colitis, it is a subtype of microscopic colitis, which is characterized by inflammation that specifically affects the colon (i.e. colitis), and a clinical presentation that involves watery diarrhea but a lack of rectal bleeding. Microscopic colitis does not usually cause macroscopic changes to the colon that allow a visual diagnosis during colonoscopy, instead causing microscopic changes that can be detected through histopathological examination of colonic biopsies. The nature of these microscopic changes is what differentiates collagenous from lymphocytic colitis, with the characteristic finding in collagenous colitis being depositions of collagen in the connective tissue between the colonic glands.[1] Collagenous colitis, and microscopic colitis as a whole, is sometimes considered to be an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) along with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. However, little is known about the etiology of microscopic colitis, and so the degree of similarity to the inflammatory bowel diseases is uncertain.[1][2]

Coarctation of aorta dominant,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarctation_of_aorta_dominant,C,"Coarctation of the aorta (CoA)[1][2] is a congenital condition whereby the aorta is narrow, usually in the area where the ductus arteriosus (ligamentum arteriosum after regression) inserts. The word coarctation means ""pressing or drawing together; narrowing"". Coarctations are most common in the aortic arch. The arch may be small in babies with coarctations. Other heart defects may also occur when coarctation is present, typically occurring on the left side of the heart. When a patient has a coarctation, the left ventricle has to work harder. Since the aorta is narrowed, the left ventricle must generate a much higher pressure than normal in order to force enough blood through the aorta to deliver blood to the lower part of the body. If the narrowing is severe enough, the left ventricle may not be strong enough to push blood through the coarctation, thus resulting in a lack of blood to the lower half of the body. Physiologically its complete form is manifested as interrupted aortic arch.[citation needed]

Specifically, antibodies against myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) damage Schwann cells. While the disorder occurs in only 10% of those afflicted with peripheral neuropathy, people afflicted have symptoms such as muscle weakness, sensory problems, and other motor deficits usually starting in the form of a tremor of the hands or trouble walking.[1][2]  There are, however, multiple treatments that range from simple exercises in order to build strength to targeted drug treatments that have been shown to improve function in people with this type of peripheral neuropathy.[3]

Cock peculiar tumor,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cock%27s_peculiar_tumour,List of eponymous diseases,"Cock's peculiar tumour is a sebaceous cyst linked growth that can resemble a squamous cell carcinoma.[1] The name is given after a 19th-century English surgeon Edward Cock.[2] The proliferating cyst is usually solitary, but it often arises from a simple trichilemmal cysts in the hair follicle epithelium and these are multiple in 70% of cases. They are most commonly found on the scalp where the proliferating trichilemmal cyst will grow to a large size and ulcerate. Chronic inflammation can cause the cyst to take the form of a granuloma. This granuloma mimics a squamous-cell carcinoma (both clinically and histologically) and these ulcerating solitary cysts are called Cock's peculiar tumour.[3]

Bruton type agammaglobulinemia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruton_type_agammaglobulinemia,B,"X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a rare genetic disorder discovered in 1952 that affects the body's ability to fight infection. As the form of agammaglobulinemia that is X-linked, it is much more common in males. In people with XLA, the white blood cell formation process does not generate mature B cells,[2] which manifests as a complete or near-complete lack of proteins called gamma globulins, including antibodies, in their bloodstream. B cells are part of the immune system and normally manufacture antibodies (also called immunoglobulins), which defend the body from infections by sustaining a humoral immunity response. Patients with untreated XLA are prone to develop serious and even fatal infections. A mutation occurs at the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) gene that leads to a severe block in B cell development (at the pre-B cell to immature B cell stage) and a reduced immunoglobulin production in the serum. Btk is particularly responsible for mediating B cell development and maturation through a signaling effect on the B cell receptor BCR. Patients typically present in early childhood with recurrent infections, in particular with extracellular, encapsulated bacteria.[3] XLA is deemed to have a relatively low incidence of disease, with an occurrence rate of approximately 1 in 200,000 live births[4] and a frequency of about 1 in 100,000[5] male newborns. It has no ethnic predisposition. XLA is treated by infusion of human antibody.  Treatment with pooled gamma globulin cannot restore a functional population of B cells, but it is sufficient to reduce the severity and number of infections due to the passive immunity granted by the exogenous antibodies.[3]

The symptoms are a result of dysfunction of  long axons in the spinal cord. The affected cells are the primary motor neurons; therefore, the disease is an upper motor neuron disease.[2] HSP is not a form of cerebral palsy even though it physically may appear and behave much the same as spastic diplegia. The origin of HSP  is different from cerebral palsy. Despite this, some of the same anti-spasticity medications used in spastic cerebral palsy are sometimes used to  treat HSP symptoms.

The diagnosis comprises between 0.24 and 0.46% of all cases of congenital heart disease.[1] The anomalous left coronary artery (LCA) usually arises from the pulmonary artery instead of the aortic sinus. In fetal life, the high pressure in the pulmonic artery and the fetal shunts enable oxygen-rich blood to flow in the LCA. By the time of birth, the pressure will decrease in the pulmonic artery and the child will have a postnatal circulation. The myocardium, which is supplied by the LCA, will therefore be dependent on collateral blood flow from the other coronary arteries, mainly the RCA. Because the pressure in RCA exceeds the pressure in LCA a collateral circulation will increase. This situation ultimately can lead to blood flowing from the RCA into the LCA retrograde and into the pulmonary artery, thus forming a left-to-right shunt.[2]

Esotropia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esotropia,E,"Esotropia (from Greek  eso 'inward' and  trope 'a turning'[1]) is a form of strabismus in which one or both eyes turn inward. The condition can be constantly present, or occur intermittently, and can give the affected individual a ""cross-eyed"" appearance.[2] It is the opposite of exotropia and usually involves more severe axis deviation than esophoria. Esotropia is sometimes erroneously called ""lazy eye"", which describes the condition of amblyopia; a reduction in vision of one or both eyes that is not the result of any pathology of the eye and cannot be resolved by the use of corrective lenses. Amblyopia can, however, arise as a result of esotropia occurring in childhood: In order to relieve symptoms of diplopia or double vision, the child's brain will ignore or ""suppress"" the image from the esotropic eye, which when allowed to continue untreated will lead to the development of amblyopia. Treatment options for esotropia include glasses to correct refractive errors (see accommodative esotropia below), the use of prisms, orthoptic exercises, or eye muscle surgery.

A cavernoma in the brain is called a cerebral cavernous malformation or CCM.  Despite its designation as a hemangioma, a cavernous hemangioma is a benign (but not harmless) condition, not a malignant tumor, as it does not display endothelial hyperplasia. The abnormal tissue causes a slowing of blood flow through the cavities, or ""caverns"". The blood vessels do not form the necessary junctions with surrounding cells, and the structural support from the smooth muscle is hindered, causing leakage into the surrounding tissue. It is the leakage of blood (hemorrhage) that causes a variety of symptoms known to be associated with the condition.

There's no clear definition of BNS but what is known so far is that unlike WM, It involves the central nervous system (CNS), infiltrated by differentiated malignant B cells and by having hyperglobulinemia.[2] This infiltration increases blood viscosity, which impairs blood circulation through small blood vessels of the brain and the eye. Some scientists proposed that a person diagnosed with BNS is typically classified into Group A and Group B depending on whether or not plasma cells are present within the brain parenchyma, leptomeninges, dura, and/or the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).[3] Symptoms are diverse and nonspecific, and they can vary depending on which aspect of the CNS is being affected. Symptoms can include a range of severity of nausea and seizures. Since the symptoms vary, there are multiple treatment options to treat the symptoms for this non-curable disease. Although there is no specific set of diagnosis for BNS, different combinations of diagnostic tools are used to narrow down and conclude the presence of BNS.

Char syndrome,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Char_syndrome,C,"Char syndrome is an autosomal dominant congenital disease caused by mutations in TFAP2B gene which affects the development of the bones of the face as well as the heart and limbs.[2][3] During embryo development, TFAP2B regulates the production of the protein AP-2β, a transcription factor that is active in the neural crest and helps regulate genes that control cell division and apoptosis.[4] There are at least 10 mutations of this gene that have been identified in people presenting Char syndrome,[5][6] which alters specific regions of the gene preventing production of the transcription factor and disrupting normal development of embryo structures. People with this condition present a very distinct facial appearance with flattened cheek bones, flat and broad tip nose, shortened distance between the nose and upper lip, triangular-shaped mouth with tick lips and strabismus. It is also characterized by a patent ductus arteriosus, which is the failure to close the ductus that connects the aorta and pulmonary artery during pre-birth life and may cause many symptoms including breathing issues and heart failure. Abnormalities of hand and finger development have also been reported in people with this condition, including short or absent fifth finger. Other abnormal findings include supernumerary nipples.[7] These conditions often affect multiple members of a family and there are no reports of non-genetic factors that might be related with incidence of this syndrome.

Erythromelalgia may occur either as a primary or secondary disorder (i.e. a disorder in and of itself or a symptom of another condition). Secondary erythromelalgia can result from small fiber peripheral neuropathy of any cause, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia,[1] hypercholesterolemia, mushroom or mercury poisoning, and some autoimmune disorders. Primary erythromelalgia is caused by mutation of the voltage-gated sodium channel α-subunit gene SCN9A.

The name is derived from the Greek roots campo (or campto), meaning bent, and melia, meaning limb. An unusual aspect of the disease is that up to two-thirds of affected 46,XY genotypic males display a range of disorders of sexual development (DSD) and genital ambiguities or may even develop as normal phenotypic females as in complete 46 XY sex reversal. An atypical form of the disease with absence of bowed limbs is called, prosaically, acampomelic campomelic dysplasia (ACD) and is found in about 10% of patients, particularly those surviving the neonatal period.[citation needed]

"Epilepsy, partial, familial","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy,_partial,_familial",E,"Focal seizures are seizures that originate within brain networks limited to one hemisphere of the brain. In most cases, each seizure type has a consistent site of onset and characteristic patterns of spread, although some individuals experience more than one type of focal seizure arising from distinct networks. Seizure activity may remain localized or propagate to the opposite hemisphere.[1] Symptoms will vary according to where the seizure occurs. When seizures occur in the frontal lobe, the patient may experience a wave-like sensation in the head. When seizures occur in the temporal lobe, a feeling of déjà vu may be experienced. When seizures are localized to the parietal lobe, a numbness or tingling may occur. With seizures occurring in the occipital lobe, visual disturbances or hallucinations have been reported.[2] Some focal seizures begin with an aura — a subjective experience that precedes or constitutes the seizure itself, particularly in focal preserved consciousness seizures.

The types of tumors frequently associated with NF2 include vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas. The main manifestation of the condition is the development of bilateral benign brain tumors in the nerve sheath of the cranial nerve VIII, which is the ""auditory-vestibular nerve"" that transmits sensory information from the inner ear to the brain. Besides, other benign brain and spinal tumors occur. Symptoms depend on the presence, localisation and growth of the tumor(s). Many people with this condition also experience vision problems. Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2 or NF II) is caused by mutations of the ""Merlin"" gene,[2] which seems to influence the form and movement of cells.

Epilepsy progressive myoclonic,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_myoclonus_epilepsy,E,"Progressive Myoclonic Epilepsies (PME) are a rare group of inherited neurodegenerative diseases characterized by myoclonus, resistance to treatment, and neurological deterioration.[2] The cause of PME depends largely on the type of PME. Most PMEs are caused by autosomal dominant or recessive and mitochondrial mutations.[2] The location of the mutation also affects the inheritance and treatment of PME. Diagnosing PME is difficult due to their genetic heterogeneity and the lack of a genetic mutation identified in some patients.[3] The prognosis depends largely on the worsening symptoms and failure to respond to treatment. There is no current cure for PME and treatment focuses on managing myoclonus and seizures through antiepileptic medication (AED).[3][2]

The clinical symptoms in MPI-CDG are caused by deficient activity of the enzyme mannose phosphate isomerase.  Clinically, the most common symptoms of MPI-CDG are chronic diarrhea, failure to thrive, protein-losing enteropathy, and coagulopathy.[1]  MPI-CDG differs from most other described glycosylation disorders due to its lack of central nervous system involvement, and because it has treatment options besides supportive care.  Treatment with oral mannose has been shown to improve most symptoms of the disease.[2]  If left untreated, MPI-CDG can be fatal.[1]  MPI-CDG was previously known as CDG-IB.  The disorder was first described clinically in 1986, and the underlying genetic defect was identified in 1998.[1][3]

GSE has key symptoms typically restricted to the bowel and associated tissues; however, there are a wide variety of associated conditions.  These include bowel disorders (diarrhoea, constipation, irritable bowel), eosinophilic gastroenteritis and increase with coeliac disease (CD) severity. With some early onset and a large percentage of late onset disease, other disorders appear prior to the coeliac diagnosis[1] or allergic-like responses (IgE or IgA, IgG) markedly increased in GSE.  Many of these disorders persist on a strict gluten-free diet (GF diet or GFD), and are thus independent of coeliac disease after triggering.

Cavernous hemangioma,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavernous_hemangioma,C,"Cavernous hemangioma, also called cavernous angioma, venous malformation, or cavernoma,[1][2] is a type of venous malformation due to endothelial dysmorphogenesis from a lesion which is present at birth. A cavernoma in the brain is called a cerebral cavernous malformation or CCM.  Despite its designation as a hemangioma, a cavernous hemangioma is a benign (but not harmless) condition, not a malignant tumor, as it does not display endothelial hyperplasia. The abnormal tissue causes a slowing of blood flow through the cavities, or ""caverns"". The blood vessels do not form the necessary junctions with surrounding cells, and the structural support from the smooth muscle is hindered, causing leakage into the surrounding tissue. It is the leakage of blood (hemorrhage) that causes a variety of symptoms known to be associated with the condition.

Carotenemia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotenemia,C,"Carotenosis is a benign and reversible medical condition where an excess of dietary carotenoids results in orange discoloration of the outermost skin layer. The discoloration is most easily observed in light-skinned people and may be mistaken for jaundice.[1][2]: 540 [3]: 681  Carotenoids are lipid-soluble compounds that include alpha- and beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin. The primary serum carotenoids are beta-carotene, lycopene, and lutein. Serum levels of carotenoids vary between region, ethnicity, and sex in the healthy population.  All are absorbed by passive diffusion from the gastrointestinal tract and are then partially metabolized in the intestinal mucosa and liver to vitamin A. From there they are transported in the plasma into the peripheral tissues. Carotenoids are eliminated via sweat, sebum, urine, and gastrointestinal secretions.[citation needed] Carotenoids contribute to normal-appearing human skin color, and are a significant component of physiologic ultraviolet photoprotection.[4]

The most common symptoms include cough, fever, difficulty breathing, and sweating at night. Eosinophilic pneumonia is diagnosed by a combination of characteristic symptoms, findings on a physical examination by a health provider, and the results of blood tests and X-rays. Prognosis is excellent once most eosinophilic pneumonia is recognized and treatment with corticosteroids is begun.

Dental phobia can include fear of dental procedures, dental environment or setting, fear of dental instruments or fear of the dentist as a person.[3] People with dental phobia often avoid the dentist and neglect oral health, which may lead to painful dental problems and ultimately force a visit to the dentist. The emergency nature of this appointment may serve to worsen the phobia. This phenomenon may also be called the cycle of dental fear.[3] Dental anxiety typically starts in childhood.[1] There is the potential for this to place strains on relationships and negatively impact on employment.[4]

"Dementia, HIV",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV_dementia,D,"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are neurological disorders associated with HIV infection and AIDS.  It is a syndrome of progressive deterioration of memory, cognition, behavior, and motor function in HIV-infected individuals during the late stages of the disease, when immunodeficiency is severe.[1] HAND may include neurological disorders of various severity. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders are associated with a metabolic encephalopathy induced by HIV infection and fueled by immune activation of macrophages and microglia.[2] These cells are actively infected with HIV and secrete neurotoxins of both host and viral origin. The essential features of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) are disabling cognitive impairment accompanied by motor dysfunction, speech problems and behavioral change.[3] Cognitive impairment is characterised by mental slowness, trouble with memory and poor concentration. Motor symptoms include a loss of fine motor control leading to clumsiness, poor balance and tremors. Behavioral changes may include apathy, lethargy and diminished emotional responses and spontaneity. Histopathologically, it is identified by the infiltration of monocytes and macrophages into the central nervous system (CNS), gliosis, pallor of myelin sheaths, abnormalities of dendritic processes and neuronal loss.[2][4]

Benign congenital hypotonia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_congenital_hypotonia,B,"Hypotonia is a state of low muscle tone[1] (the amount of tension or resistance to stretch in a muscle), often involving reduced muscle strength. Hypotonia is not a specific medical disorder, but it is a potential manifestation of many different diseases and disorders that affect motor nerve control by the brain or muscle strength. Hypotonia is a lack of resistance to passive movement whereas muscle weakness results in impaired active movement. Central hypotonia originates from the central nervous system, while peripheral hypotonia is related to problems within the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, and/or skeletal muscles.[2] Severe hypotonia in infancy is commonly known as floppy baby syndrome. Recognizing hypotonia, even in early infancy, is usually relatively straightforward, but diagnosing the underlying cause can be difficult and often unsuccessful. The long-term effects of hypotonia on a child's development and later life depend primarily on the severity of the muscle weakness and the nature of the cause. Some disorders have a specific treatment but the principal treatment for most hypotonia of idiopathic or neurologic cause is physical therapy and/or occupational therapy for remediation.

Andersen disease,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andersen_disease,List of eponymous diseases,"Glycogen storage disease type IV (GSD IV), or Andersen's Disease,[2][3] is a form of glycogen storage disease, which is caused by an inborn error of metabolism. It is the result of a mutation in the GBE1 gene, which causes a defect in the glycogen branching enzyme. Therefore, glycogen is not made properly, and abnormal glycogen molecules accumulate in cells; most severely in cardiac and muscle cells. The severity of this disease varies on the amount of enzyme produced. GSD IV is autosomal recessive, which means each parent has a mutant copy of the gene but shows no symptoms of the disease. Having an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, males and females are equally likely to be affected by Andersen's disease. Classic Andersen's disease typically becomes apparent during the first few months after the patient is born. Approximately 1 in 20,000 to 25,000 newborns have a glycogen storage disease.[4] Andersen's disease affects 1 in 800,000 individuals worldwide, with 3% of all GSDs being type IV.[5] The disease was described and studied first by Dorothy Hansine Andersen.[6][7]

Carbonic anhydrase II deficiency,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonic_anhydrase_II_deficiency,C,"Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a medical condition that involves an accumulation of acid in the body due to a failure of the kidneys to appropriately acidify the urine.[1] In renal physiology, when blood is filtered by the kidney, the filtrate passes through the tubules of the nephron, allowing for exchange of salts, acid equivalents, and other solutes before it drains into the bladder as urine. The metabolic acidosis that results from RTA may be caused either by insufficient secretion of hydrogen ions (which are acidic) into the latter portions of the nephron (the distal tubule) or by failure to reabsorb sufficient bicarbonate ions (which are alkaline) from the filtrate in the early portion of the nephron (the proximal tubule). Although a metabolic acidosis also occurs in those with chronic kidney disease, the term RTA is reserved for individuals with poor urinary acidification in otherwise well-functioning kidneys. Several different types of RTA exist, which all have different syndromes and different causes. RTA is usually an incidental finding based on routine blood draws that show abnormal results. Clinically, patients may present with vague symptoms such as dehydration, mental status changes, or delayed growth in adolescents.[2]

These deposits can cause thickening of different sections of the heart, leading to decreased cardiac function.[1] The overall decrease in cardiac function leads to a plethora of symptoms.[2] This multisystem disease was often misdiagnosed, with a corrected analysis only during autopsy. Advancements of technologies have increased earlier accuracy of diagnosis. Cardiac amyloidosis has multiple sub-types including light chain, familial, and senile.[3] One of the most studied types is light chain cardiac amyloidosis.[2] Prognosis depends on the extent of the deposits in the body and the type of amyloidosis.[4] New treatment methods are actively being researched in regards to the treatment of heart failure and specific cardiac amyloidosis problems.[5][6]

However, many individuals may go undiagnosed due to rarity of the disease.[2][3] Most individuals develop symptoms between the ages of 20–50; however, cases outside of this age range have been reported as well.[1]

Defective apolipoprotein B-100,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defective_apolipoprotein_B-100,D,"Apolipoprotein B deficiency is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from a missense mutation which reduces the affinity of apoB-100 for the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL Receptor). This causes impairments in LDL catabolism, resulting in increased levels of low-density lipoprotein in the blood. The clinical manifestations are similar to diseases produced by mutations of the LDL receptor, such as familial hypercholesterolemia. Treatment may include, niacin or statin or ezetimibe.[1]: 534

Decompensated phoria,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompensated_phoria,D,"Heterophoria is an eye condition in which the directions that the eyes are pointing at rest position, when not performing binocular fusion, are not the same as each other, or, ""not straight"". This condition can be esophoria, where the eyes tend to cross inward in the absence of fusion; exophoria, in which they diverge; hyperphoria, in which one eye points up or down relative to the other; or cyclophoria, in which one eye is rotated differently around its line of sight from that of the other. Phorias are known as 'latent squint' because the tendency of the eyes to deviate is kept latent (hidden) by fusion.[1]  A person with two normal eyes has single vision (usually) because of the combined use of the sensory and motor systems.  The motor system acts to point both eyes at the target of interest; any offset is detected visually (and the motor system corrects it).  Heterophoria occurs only during dissociation of the left eye and right eye, when fusion of the eyes is absent. If you cover one eye (e.g., with your hand) you remove the sensory information about the eye's position in the orbit.  Without this, there is no stimulus to binocular fusion, and the eye will move to a position of ""rest"".  The difference between this position, and where it would be were the eye uncovered, is the heterophoria. The opposite of heterophoria, where the eyes are straight when relaxed and not fusing, is called orthophoria.

Basal ganglia diseases,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_ganglia_diseases,B,"Basal ganglia disease is a group of physical problems that occur when the group of nuclei in the brain known as the basal ganglia fail to properly suppress unwanted movements or to properly prime upper motor neuron circuits to initiate motor function.[1] Research indicates that increased output of the basal ganglia inhibits thalamocortical projection neurons. Proper activation or deactivation of these neurons is an integral component for proper movement. If something causes too much basal ganglia output, then the ventral anterior (VA) and ventral lateral (VL) thalamocortical projection neurons become too inhibited, and one cannot initiate voluntary movement. These disorders are known as hypokinetic disorders. However, a disorder leading to abnormally low output of the basal ganglia leads to reduced inhibition, and thus excitation, of the thalamocortical projection neurons (VA and VL) which synapse onto the cortex. This situation leads to an inability to suppress unwanted movements. These disorders are known as hyperkinetic disorders.[2]

BANF acoustic neurinoma,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BANF_acoustic_neurinoma,B,"Neurofibromatosis type II (also known as MISME syndrome – multiple inherited schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas) is a genetic condition that may be inherited or may arise spontaneously, and causes benign tumors of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. The types of tumors frequently associated with NF2 include vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas. The main manifestation of the condition is the development of bilateral benign brain tumors in the nerve sheath of the cranial nerve VIII, which is the ""auditory-vestibular nerve"" that transmits sensory information from the inner ear to the brain. Besides, other benign brain and spinal tumors occur. Symptoms depend on the presence, localisation and growth of the tumor(s). Many people with this condition also experience vision problems. Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2 or NF II) is caused by mutations of the ""Merlin"" gene,[2] which seems to influence the form and movement of cells. The principal treatments consist of neurosurgical removal of the tumors and surgical treatment of the eye lesions. Historically the underlying disorder has not had any therapy due to the cell function caused by the genetic mutation.

Bahemuka–Brown syndrome,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahemuka%E2%80%93Brown_syndrome,B,"Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a group of inherited diseases whose main feature is a progressive gait disorder. The disease presents with progressive stiffness (spasticity)  and contraction in the lower limbs.[1] HSP is also known as hereditary spastic paraparesis, familial spastic paraplegia, French settlement disease, Strumpell disease, or Strumpell-Lorrain disease.  The symptoms are a result of dysfunction of  long axons in the spinal cord. The affected cells are the primary motor neurons; therefore, the disease is an upper motor neuron disease.[2] HSP is not a form of cerebral palsy even though it physically may appear and behave much the same as spastic diplegia. The origin of HSP  is different from cerebral palsy. Despite this, some of the same anti-spasticity medications used in spastic cerebral palsy are sometimes used to  treat HSP symptoms.

Symptoms such as poor growth and enlarged liver are associated with the clinical presentation of the disease.[2] If not detected via newborn screening and management not begun before symptoms appear, clinical manifestation of disease occurs typically within the first two years of life. The severity of the disease is correlated with the timing of onset of symptoms, earlier being more severe.[1] If diagnosed through newborn screening prior to clinical manifestation, and well managed with diet and medication, normal growth and development is possible.

While having a low morbidity rate, as many as 10% of patients with MSK have an increased risk of morbidity associated with frequent stones and UTIs. While many patients report increased chronic kidney pain, the source of the pain, when a UTI or blockage is not present, is unclear at this time. Renal colic (flank and back pain) is present in 55% of patients. Women with MSK experience more stones, UTIs, and complications than men.

This does not include the congenital defect situs inversus,[1] which results when arrangement of all the organs in the abdomen and chest are mirrored, so the positions are opposite the normal placement. Situs inversus is the mirror image of situs solitus, which is normal asymmetric distribution of the abdominothoracic visceral organs. Situs ambiguus can also be subdivided into left-isomerism and right-isomerism based on the defects observed in the spleen, lungs and atria of the heart.

X-linked agammaglobulinemia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-linked_agammaglobulinemia,X,"X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a rare genetic disorder discovered in 1952 that affects the body's ability to fight infection. As the form of agammaglobulinemia that is X-linked, it is much more common in males. In people with XLA, the white blood cell formation process does not generate mature B cells,[2] which manifests as a complete or near-complete lack of proteins called gamma globulins, including antibodies, in their bloodstream. B cells are part of the immune system and normally manufacture antibodies (also called immunoglobulins), which defend the body from infections by sustaining a humoral immunity response. Patients with untreated XLA are prone to develop serious and even fatal infections. A mutation occurs at the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) gene that leads to a severe block in B cell development (at the pre-B cell to immature B cell stage) and a reduced immunoglobulin production in the serum. Btk is particularly responsible for mediating B cell development and maturation through a signaling effect on the B cell receptor BCR. Patients typically present in early childhood with recurrent infections, in particular with extracellular, encapsulated bacteria.[3] XLA is deemed to have a relatively low incidence of disease, with an occurrence rate of approximately 1 in 200,000 live births[4] and a frequency of about 1 in 100,000[5] male newborns. It has no ethnic predisposition. XLA is treated by infusion of human antibody.  Treatment with pooled gamma globulin cannot restore a functional population of B cells, but it is sufficient to reduce the severity and number of infections due to the passive immunity granted by the exogenous antibodies.[3]

The family history was consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance of intrauterine growth retardation and small head size, but these features are not unique to this condition and no linkage to a specific gene was ever established.  In fact, the condition appears to have been abandoned, given that the OMIM number (308400) assigned to it ([1]) and listed in a review article on X-linked mental retardation[2] has been removed from the OMIM database. Furthermore, this condition is no longer mentioned in a more recent review of X-linked mental retardation.[3]

Pemphigus vulgaris,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemphigus_vulgaris,List of autoimmune diseases,"Pemphigus vulgaris is a rare chronic blistering skin disease and the most common form of pemphigus. Pemphigus was derived from the Greek word pemphix, meaning blister.[1] It is classified as a type II hypersensitivity reaction in which antibodies are formed against desmosomes, components of the skin that function to keep certain layers of skin bound to each other.  As desmosomes are attacked, the layers of skin separate and the clinical picture resembles a blister. These blisters are due to acantholysis, or breaking apart of intercellular connections through an autoantibody-mediated response.[2] Over time the condition inevitably progresses without treatment: lesions increase in size and distribution throughout the body, behaving physiologically like a severe burn.

Goodpasture syndrome,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodpasture_syndrome,List of autoimmune diseases,"Goodpasture syndrome (GPS), also known as anti–glomerular basement membrane disease,  is a rare autoimmune disease in which antibodies attack the basement membrane in lungs and kidneys, leading to bleeding from the lungs, glomerulonephritis,[1] and kidney failure.[2] It is thought to attack the alpha-3 subunit of type IV collagen, which has therefore been referred to as Goodpasture's antigen.[3] Goodpasture syndrome may quickly result in permanent lung and kidney damage, often leading to death. It is treated with medications that suppress the immune system such as corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, and with plasmapheresis, in which the antibodies are removed from the blood. Due to the GPS's rapid progression, the significant difficulty of treating the disease is identifying it early and making the appropriate response before severe damage occurs to the kidneys and or lungs. Consequently, the standard treatment plan of corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and plasmapheresis is vigorous and fast-acting, including high plasma volume exchange and an intensive dose of corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide based on the patient's body weight in kilograms.

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_hemolytic_anemia,List of autoimmune diseases,"Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) occurs when a person's immune system produces antibodies directed against their own red blood cells (RBCs). These antibodies attach to red cells, causing them to break down (lyse), and reducing the number of oxygen-carrying red blood cells in circulation (anemia).[1][2] The antibodies are usually directed against common red cell antigens, therefore they also bind to allogenic or transfused red cells and cause them to lyse. (ref).[3][4][5] Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia can be caused by different types of antibodies with reactivity at different temperatures. The one caused by IgG antibodies is called warm-immune haemolytic anaemia and has an incidence of 5-10 cases per million whereas ‘cold agglutinin disease’ is caused by IgM antibodies with an incidence of 1-1.8 cases per million.

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_thrombocytopenic_purpura,List of autoimmune diseases,"Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), also known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or immune thrombocytopenia, is an autoimmune primary disorder of hemostasis characterized by a low platelet count in the absence of other causes.[1][2] ITP often results in an increased risk of bleeding from mucosal surfaces (such as the nose or gums) or the skin (causing purpura and bruises).[1] Depending on which age group is affected, ITP causes two distinct clinical syndromes: an acute form observed in children and a chronic form in adults. Acute ITP often follows a viral infection and is typically self-limited (resolving within two months), while the more chronic form (persisting for longer than six months) does not yet have a specific identified cause. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of ITP is similar in both syndromes involving antibodies against various platelet surface antigens such as glycoproteins.

"
Penicillin allergy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effects_of_penicillin,List of autoimmune diseases,"
The side effects of penicillin are bodily responses to penicillin and closely related antibiotics that do not relate directly to its effect on bacteria. A side effect is an effect that is not intended with normal dosing.[1]  Some of these reactions are visible and some occur in the body's organs or blood. Penicillins are a widely used group of medications that are effective for the treatment of a wide variety of bacterial infections in human adults and children as well as other species. Some side effects are predictable, of which some are common but not serious, some are uncommon and serious and others are rare.[2] The route of administration of penicillin can have an effect on the development of side effects. An example of this is irritation and inflammation that develops at a peripheral infusion site when penicillin is administered intravenously. In addition, penicillin is available in different forms. There are different penicillin medications (penicillin G benzathine, penicillin G potassium, Penicillin G sodium, penicillin G procaine, and penicillin V)[3] as well as a number of β-lactam antibiotics derived from penicillin (e.g. amoxicillin).

Primary immunodeficiency,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_immunodeficiency,List of autoimmune diseases,"Primary immunodeficiencies are disorders in which part of the body's immune system is missing or does not function normally.[1] To be considered a primary immunodeficiency (PID), the immune deficiency must be inborn, not caused by secondary factors such as other disease, drug treatment, or environmental exposure to toxins. Most primary immunodeficiencies are genetic disorders; the majority are diagnosed in children under the age of one, although milder forms may not be recognized until adulthood. While there are over 430 recognized inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) as of 2019, the vast majority of which are PIDs, most are very rare.[2][3][4]  About 1 in 500 people in the United States are born with a primary immunodeficiency.[5]  Immune deficiencies can result in persistent or recurring infections, auto-inflammatory disorders, tumors, and disorders of various organs.  There are currently limited treatments available for these conditions; most are specific to a particular type of PID. Research is currently evaluating the use of stem cell transplants (HSCT) and experimental gene therapies as avenues for treatment in limited subsets of PIDs.

Yusho disease,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusho_disease,Y,"Yushō disease (油症, lit. 'oil symptoms') was a mass poisoning by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) which occurred in northern Kyūshū, Japan, in 1968.[1][2][3] In January 1968, rice bran oil produced by Kanemi Company in Kyushu was contaminated with PCBs and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) during production. For deodorization, the oil was heated using PCB as the heating medium, circulating through pipes. Due to holes in the pipes, the PCB leaked into the rice bran oil. The contaminated rice bran oil was then sold to poultry farmers for use as a feed supplement and to consumers for use in cooking.[4] In February to March 1968, farmers started reporting that their poultry were dying due to apparent difficulty in breathing; altogether 400,000 birds died.[4] About 14,000 people who had consumed the contaminated rice oil were affected in Japan.[4] More than 500 died.[5] Common symptoms included dermal and ocular lesions, and a lowered immune response.[1][2][6] Other symptoms included fatigue, headache, cough, and unusual skin sores.[7] Additionally, in children, there were reports of poor cognitive development.[1][6][7]

Gastric folds,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_folds,List of intestinal diseases,"The gastric folds (or gastric rugae) are coiled sections of tissue that exist in the mucosal and submucosal layers of the stomach.[1] They provide elasticity by allowing the stomach to expand when a bolus enters it. These folds stretch outward through the action of mechanoreceptors, which respond to the increase in pressure.[2] This allows the stomach to expand, therefore increasing the volume of the stomach without increasing pressure.[2] They also provide the stomach with an increased surface area for nutrient absorption during digestion.[2] Gastric folds may be seen during esophagogastroduodenoscopy or in radiological studies.[3][4]
"
Gastric pits,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_pits,List of intestinal diseases,"Gastric pits are indentations in the stomach which denote entrances to 3-5 tubular gastric glands.[1][2] They are deeper in the pylorus than they are in the other parts of the stomach. The human stomach has several million of these pits which dot the surface of the lining epithelium. Surface mucous cells line the pits themselves but give way to a series of other types of cells which then line the glands themselves.

The pylorus is considered as having two parts, the pyloric antrum (opening to the body of the stomach) and the pyloric canal (opening to the duodenum). The pyloric canal ends as the pyloric orifice, which marks the junction between the stomach and the duodenum. The orifice is surrounded by a sphincter, a band of muscle, called the pyloric sphincter.
The word pylorus comes from Greek πυλωρός, via Latin. The word pylorus in Greek means ""gatekeeper"", related to ""gate"" (Greek: pyle) and is thus linguistically related to the word ""pylon"".[1]
"
Parietal cells,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_cell,List of intestinal diseases,"Parietal cells (also known as oxyntic cells) are epithelial cells in the stomach that secrete hydrochloric acid (HCl) and intrinsic factor.  These cells are located in the gastric glands found in the lining of the fundus and body regions of the stomach.[1] They contain an extensive secretory network of canaliculi from which the HCl is secreted by active transport into the stomach. The enzyme hydrogen potassium ATPase (H+/K+ ATPase) is unique to the parietal cells and transports the H+ against a concentration gradient of about 3 million to 1,[citation needed] which is the steepest[citation needed] ion gradient formed in the human body.  Parietal cells are primarily regulated via histamine, acetylcholine and gastrin signalling from both central and local modulators.

Pituitary,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary_gland,List of intestinal diseases,"The pituitary gland or hypophysis is an endocrine gland in vertebrates. In humans, the pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain, protruding off the bottom of the hypothalamus. The pituitary gland and the hypothalamus control much of the body's endocrine system.[2] It is seated in part of the sella turcica a depression in the sphenoid bone, known as the hypophyseal fossa. The human pituitary gland is oval shaped, about 1 cm in diameter, 0.5–1 gram (0.018–0.035 oz) in weight on average, and about the size of a kidney bean.[3][4]
"
Female,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_reproductive_system,List of intestinal diseases,"The human female reproductive system is made up of the internal and external sex organs that function in the reproduction of new offspring. The reproductive system is immature at birth and develops at puberty to be able to release matured ova from the ovaries, facilitate their fertilization, and create a protective environment for the developing fetus during pregnancy. The female reproductive tract is made of several connected internal sex organs—the vagina, uterus, and fallopian tubes—and is prone to infections.[1] The vagina allows for sexual intercourse and childbirth, and is connected to the uterus at the cervix.  The uterus (or womb) accommodates the embryo by developing the uterine lining.

Placenta,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta,List of intestinal diseases,"The placenta (pl.: placentas or placentae) is a temporary embryonic and later fetal organ that begins developing from the blastocyst shortly after implantation. It plays critical roles in facilitating nutrient, gas and waste exchange between the physically separate maternal and fetal circulations, and is an important endocrine organ, producing hormones that regulate both maternal and fetal physiology during pregnancy.[1] The placenta connects to the fetus via the umbilical cord, and on the opposite aspect to the maternal uterus in a species-dependent manner. In humans, a thin layer of maternal decidual (endometrial) tissue comes away with the placenta when it is expelled from the uterus following birth (sometimes incorrectly referred to as the 'maternal part' of the placenta). Placentas are a defining characteristic of placental mammals, but are also found in marsupials and some non-mammals with varying levels of development.[2]

The first or primary bronchi to branch from the trachea at the carina are the right main bronchus and the left main bronchus. These are the widest bronchi, and enter the right lung, and the left lung at each hilum. The main bronchi branch into narrower secondary bronchi or lobar bronchi, and these branch into narrower tertiary bronchi or segmental bronchi. Further divisions of the segmental bronchi are known as 4th order, 5th order, and 6th order segmental bronchi, or grouped together as subsegmental bronchi.[1][2]
The bronchi, when too narrow to be supported by cartilage, are known as bronchioles. No gas exchange takes place in the bronchi.

Tissue,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_tissue,List of intestinal diseases,"Nervous tissue, also called neural tissue, is the main tissue component of the nervous system. The nervous system regulates and controls body functions and activity. It consists of two parts: the central nervous system (CNS) comprising the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) comprising the branching peripheral nerves. It is composed of neurons, also known as nerve cells, which receive and transmit impulses to and from it , and neuroglia, also known as glial cells or glia, which assist the propagation of the nerve impulse as well as provide nutrients to the neurons.[1]

A sensory system consists of sensory neurons (including the sensory receptor cells), neural pathways, and parts of the brain involved in sensory perception and interoception.  Commonly recognized sensory systems are those for vision, hearing, touch, taste, smell, balance and visceral sensation. Sense organs are transducers that convert data from the outer physical world to the realm of the mind where people interpret the information, creating their perception of the world around them.[1]
"
Nerve,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve,List of intestinal diseases,"A nerve is an enclosed, cable-like bundle of nerve fibers (called axons). Nerves have historically been considered the basic units of the peripheral nervous system. A nerve provides a common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses called action potentials that are transmitted along each of the axons to peripheral organs or, in the case of sensory nerves, from the periphery back to the central nervous system. Each axon is an extension of an individual neuron, along with other supportive cells such as some Schwann cells that coat the axons in myelin. 
"
Glymphatic system,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glymphatic_system,List of intestinal diseases,"The glymphatic system, glymphatic clearance pathway or paravascular system is an organ system for metabolic waste removal in the central nervous system (CNS) of vertebrates. According to this model, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), an ultrafiltrated plasma fluid secreted by choroid plexuses in the cerebral ventricles, flows into the paravascular space around cerebral arteries, contacts and mixes with interstitial fluid (ISF) and solutes within the brain parenchyma, and exits via the cerebral venous paravascular spaces back into the subarachnoid space.[1] The pathway consists of a para-arterial influx mechanism for CSF driven primarily by arterial pulsation,[2] which ""massages"" the low-pressure CSF into the denser brain parenchyma, and the CSF flow is regulated during sleep by changes in parenchyma resistance due to expansion and contraction of the extracellular space. Clearance of soluble proteins, metabolites and excess extracellular fluid is accomplished through convective bulk flow of ISF, facilitated by astrocytic aquaporin 4 (AQP4) water channels.[3]

Lymphatic vessel,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphatic_vessel,List of intestinal diseases,"The lymphatic vessels (or lymph vessels or lymphatics) are thin-walled vessels (tubes), structured like blood vessels, that carry lymph. As part of the lymphatic system, lymph vessels are complementary to the cardiovascular system. Lymph vessels are lined by endothelial cells, and have a thin layer of smooth muscle, and adventitia that binds the lymph vessels to the surrounding tissue. Lymph vessels are devoted to the propulsion of the lymph from the lymph capillaries, which are mainly concerned with the absorption of interstitial fluid from the tissues. Lymph capillaries are slightly bigger than their counterpart capillaries of the vascular system. Lymph vessels that carry lymph to a lymph node are called afferent lymph vessels, and those that carry it from a lymph node are called efferent lymph vessels, from where the lymph may travel to another lymph node, may be returned to a vein, or may travel to a larger lymph duct. Lymph ducts drain the lymph into one of the subclavian veins and thus return it to general circulation.

Vein,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein,List of intestinal diseases,"Veins (/veɪn/) are blood vessels in the circulatory system of humans and most other animals that carry blood towards the heart. Most veins carry deoxygenated blood from the tissues back to the heart; exceptions are those of the pulmonary and fetal circulations which carry oxygenated blood to the heart. In the systemic circulation, arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, and veins return deoxygenated blood to the heart, in the deep veins.[1]
"
Fibrous joint,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrous_joint,List of intestinal diseases,"In anatomy, fibrous  joints are joints connected by fibrous tissue, consisting mainly of collagen. These are fixed joints where bones are united by a layer of white fibrous tissue of varying thickness. In the skull, the joints between the bones are called sutures. Such immovable joints are also referred to as synarthroses.
"
Muscle,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle,List of intestinal diseases,"Muscle is a soft tissue, one of the four basic types of animal tissue. There are three types of muscle tissue in vertebrates: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle.  Muscle tissue gives skeletal muscles the ability to contract.  Muscle tissue contains special contractile proteins called actin and myosin which interact to cause movement. Among many other muscle proteins, present are two regulatory proteins, troponin and tropomyosin.[1] Muscle is formed during embryonic development, in a process known as myogenesis.[2]
"
Cartilaginous joint,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilaginous_joint,List of intestinal diseases,"Cartilaginous joints are connected entirely by cartilage (fibrocartilage or hyaline).[1]  Cartilaginous joints allow more movement between bones than a fibrous joint but less than the highly mobile synovial joint.  Cartilaginous joints also forms the growth regions of immature long bones and the intervertebral discs of the spinal column.
"
Cartilage,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage,List of intestinal diseases,"Cartilage is a resilient and smooth type of connective tissue. Semi-transparent and non-porous, it is usually covered by a tough and fibrous membrane called perichondrium. In tetrapods, it covers and protects the ends of long bones at the joints as articular cartilage,[1] and is a structural component of many body parts including the rib cage, the neck and the bronchial tubes, and the intervertebral discs. In other taxa, such as chondrichthyans and cyclostomes, it constitutes a much greater proportion of the skeleton.[2] It is not as hard and rigid as bone, but it is much stiffer and much less flexible than muscle. The matrix of cartilage is made up of glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, collagen fibers and, sometimes, elastin. It usually grows quicker than bone.
"
Rib,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib,List of intestinal diseases,"In vertebrate anatomy, ribs (Latin: costae) are the long curved bones which form the rib cage, part of the axial skeleton.[1] In most tetrapods, ribs surround the thoracic cavity, enabling the lungs to expand and thus facilitate breathing by expanding the thoracic cavity. They serve to protect the lungs, heart, and other vital organs of the thorax. In some animals, especially snakes, ribs may provide support and protection for the entire body.

The diaphragm is the most important muscle of respiration,[3] and separates the thoracic cavity, containing the heart and lungs, from the abdominal cavity: as the diaphragm contracts, the volume of the thoracic cavity increases, creating a negative pressure there, which draws air into the lungs.[4] Its high oxygen consumption is noted by the many mitochondria and capillaries present; more than in any other skeletal muscle.[3]
"
Vertebra,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column,List of intestinal diseases,"The spinal column, also known as the vertebral column, spine or backbone, is the core part of the axial skeleton in vertebrates. The vertebral column is the defining and eponymous characteristic of the vertebrate. The spinal column is a segmented column of vertebrae that surrounds and protects the spinal cord. The vertebrae are separated by intervertebral discs in a series of cartilaginous joints.[1] The dorsal portion of the spinal column houses the spinal canal, an elongated cavity formed by the alignment of the vertebral neural arches that encloses and protects the spinal cord, with spinal nerves exiting via the intervertebral foramina to innervate each body segment.

Ulna,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulna,List of intestinal diseases,"The ulna or ulnar bone (pl.: ulnae or ulnas)[3] is a long bone in the forearm stretching from the elbow to the wrist. It is on the same side of the forearm as the little finger, running parallel to the radius, the forearm's other long bone. Longer and thinner than the radius, the ulna is considered to be the smaller long bone of the lower arm. The corresponding bone in the lower leg is the fibula.
"
Tibia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia,List of intestinal diseases,"The tibia (/ˈtɪbiə/; pl.: tibiae /ˈtɪbii/ or tibias), also known as the shinbone or shankbone, is the larger, stronger, and anterior (frontal) of the two bones in the leg below the knee in vertebrates (the other being the fibula, behind and to the outside of the tibia); it connects the knee with the ankle. The tibia is found on the medial side of the leg next to the fibula and closer to the median plane. The tibia is connected to the fibula by the interosseous membrane of leg, forming a type of fibrous joint called a syndesmosis with very little movement. The tibia is named for the flute tibia. It is the second largest bone in the human body, after the femur. The leg bones are the strongest long bones as they support the rest of the body.

Phalanges,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_bone,List of intestinal diseases,"The phalanges /fəˈlændʒiːz/ (sg.: phalanx /ˈfælæŋks/) are digital bones in the hands and feet of most vertebrates. In primates, the thumbs and big toes have two phalanges while the other digits have three phalanges. The phalanges are classed as long bones.
"
Sternum,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternum,List of intestinal diseases,"The sternum (pl.: sternums or sterna) or breastbone is a long flat bone located in the central part of the chest. It connects to the ribs via cartilage and forms the front of the rib cage, thus helping to protect the heart, lungs, and major blood vessels from injury. Shaped roughly like a necktie, it is one of the largest and longest flat bones of the body. Its three regions are the manubrium, the body, and the xiphoid process.[1] The word sternum originates from Ancient Greek στέρνον (stérnon) 'chest'.

Humerus,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus,List of intestinal diseases,"The humerus (/ˈhjuːmərəs/; pl.: humeri) is a long bone in the arm that runs from the shoulder to the elbow. It connects the scapula and the two bones of the lower arm, the radius and ulna, and consists of three sections. The humeral upper extremity consists of a rounded head, a narrow neck, and two short processes (tubercles, sometimes called tuberosities). The body is cylindrical in its upper portion, and more prismatic below. The lower extremity consists of 2 epicondyles, 2 processes (trochlea and capitulum), and 3 fossae (radial fossa, coronoid fossa, and olecranon fossa). As well as its true anatomical neck, the constriction below the greater and lesser tubercles of the humerus is referred to as its surgical neck due to its tendency to fracture, thus often becoming the focus of surgeons.

Collar bone,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavicle,List of intestinal diseases,"The clavicle, collarbone, or keybone is a slender, S-shaped long bone approximately 6 inches (15 cm) long[1] that serves as a strut between the shoulder blade and the sternum (breastbone). There are two clavicles, one on each side of the body. The clavicle is the only long bone in the body that lies horizontally.[2] Together with the shoulder blade, it makes up the shoulder girdle. It is a palpable bone and, in people who have less fat in this region, the location of the bone is clearly visible. It receives its name from Latin clavicula 'little key' because the bone rotates along its axis like a key when the shoulder is abducted. The clavicle is the most commonly fractured bone. It can easily be fractured by impacts to the shoulder from the force of falling on outstretched arms or by a direct hit.[3]

Carpus,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_bones,List of intestinal diseases,"The carpal bones are the eight small bones that make up the wrist (carpus) that connects the hand to the forearm. The terms ""carpus"" and ""carpal"" are derived from the Latin carpus and the Greek καρπός (karpós), meaning ""wrist"". In human anatomy, the main role of the carpal bones is to articulate with the radial and ulnar heads to form a highly mobile condyloid joint (i.e. wrist joint),[1] to provide attachments for thenar and hypothenar muscles, and to form part of the rigid carpal tunnel which allows the median nerve and tendons of the anterior forearm muscles to be transmitted to the hand and fingers.

Gastrointestinal physiology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_physiology,List of intestinal diseases,"Gastrointestinal physiology is the branch of human physiology that addresses the physical function of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The function of the GI tract is to process ingested food by mechanical and chemical means, extract nutrients and excrete waste products. The GI tract is composed of the alimentary canal, that runs from the mouth to the anus, as well as the associated glands, chemicals, hormones, and enzymes that assist in digestion. The major processes that occur in the GI tract are: motility, secretion, regulation, digestion and circulation. The proper function and coordination of these processes are vital for maintaining good health by providing for the effective digestion and uptake of nutrients.[1][2]

bracket clocks,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket_clock,List of intestinal diseases,"A bracket clock is a style of antique portable table clock made in the 17th and 18th centuries.[1]  The term originated with small weight-driven pendulum clocks (sometimes called 'true bracket clocks') that had to be mounted on a bracket on the wall to allow room for their hanging weights.[2]  When spring-driven clocks were developed, which didn't require hanging weights to power them, they continued to be made in the bracket style.  Often they are composed of two matching pieces created as an ensemble: the clock and its small decorative shelf.  They are almost always made of wood, often ebony, and often ornamented with ormolu mounts, brass inlay, wood or tortoise shell veneer, or decorative varnish.  Since in their day clocks were expensive, and a household would not have one in every room, bracket clocks usually had handles to carry them from room to room.

Biopsies,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy,List of intestinal diseases,"A biopsy is a medical test commonly performed by a surgeon, an interventional radiologist, or an interventional cardiologist. The process involves the extraction of sample cells or tissues for examination to determine the presence or extent of a disease. The tissue is then fixed, dehydrated, embedded, sectioned, stained and mounted[1] before it is generally examined under a microscope by a pathologist; it may also be analyzed chemically. When an entire lump or suspicious area is removed, the procedure is called an excisional biopsy. An incisional biopsy or core biopsy samples a portion of the abnormal tissue without attempting to remove the entire lesion or tumor. When a sample of tissue or fluid is removed with a needle in such a way that cells are removed without preserving the histological architecture of the tissue cells, the procedure is called a needle aspiration biopsy. Biopsies are most commonly performed for insight into possible cancerous or inflammatory conditions.

Capsule endoscopy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_endoscopy,List of intestinal diseases,"Capsule endoscopy is a medical procedure used to record internal images of the gastrointestinal tract for use in disease diagnosis. Newer developments are also able to take biopsies and release medication at specific locations of the entire gastrointestinal tract.[1] Unlike the more widely used endoscope, capsule endoscopy provides the ability to see the middle portion of the small intestine. It can be applied to the detection of various gastrointestinal cancers, digestive diseases, ulcers, unexplained bleedings, and general abdominal pains. After a patient swallows the capsule, it passes along the gastrointestinal tract, taking a number of images per second which are transmitted wirelessly to an array of receivers connected to a portable recording device carried by the patient. General advantages of capsule endoscopy over standard endoscopy include the minimally invasive procedure setup, ability to visualize more of the gastrointestinal tract, and lower cost of the procedure.[2][medical citation needed]

There are two types of sigmoidoscopy: flexible sigmoidoscopy, which uses a flexible endoscope, and rigid sigmoidoscopy, which uses a rigid device. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is generally the preferred procedure. A sigmoidoscopy is similar to, but not the same as, a colonoscopy. A sigmoidoscopy only examines up to the sigmoid, the most distal part of the colon, while colonoscopy examines the whole large bowel.
"
Radioopaque,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioopaque,List of intestinal diseases,"Radiodensity (or radiopacity) is opacity to the radio wave and X-ray portion of the electromagnetic spectrum: that is, the relative inability of those kinds of electromagnetic radiation to pass through a particular material. Radiolucency or hypodensity indicates greater passage (greater transradiancy) to X-ray photons[1] and is the analogue of transparency and translucency with visible light. Materials that inhibit the passage of electromagnetic radiation are called radiodense or radiopaque, while those that allow radiation to pass more freely are referred to as radiolucent. Radiopaque volumes of material have white appearance on radiographs, compared with the relatively darker appearance of radiolucent volumes. For example, on typical radiographs, bones look white or light gray (radiopaque), whereas muscle and skin look black or dark gray, being mostly invisible (radiolucent).

fresh red blood,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haematochezia,List of intestinal diseases,"Hematochezia is a form of blood in stool, in which fresh blood passes through the anus while defecating. It differs from melena, which commonly refers to blood in stool originating from upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).[1] The term derives from Greek αἷμα (""blood"") and χέζειν (""to defaecate""). Hematochezia is commonly associated with lower gastrointestinal bleeding, but may also occur from a brisk upper gastrointestinal bleed. The difference between hematochezia and rectorrhagia is that rectal bleeding is not associated with defecation; instead, it is associated with expulsion of fresh bright red blood without stools.[2] The phrase bright red blood per rectum is associated with hematochezia and rectorrhagia.

"
Blood in stool,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_in_stool,List of intestinal diseases,"Blood in stool looks different depending on how early it enters the digestive tract—and thus how much digestive action it has been exposed to—and how much there is. The term can refer either to melena, with a black appearance, typically originating from upper gastrointestinal bleeding; or to hematochezia, with a red color, typically originating from lower gastrointestinal bleeding.[6] Evaluation of the blood found in stool depends on its characteristics, in terms of color, quantity and other features, which can point to its source, however, more serious conditions can present with a mixed picture, or with the form of bleeding that is found in another section of the tract.[6][4] The term ""blood in stool"" is usually only used to describe visible blood, and not fecal occult blood, which is found only after physical examination and chemical laboratory testing.
"
barium swallow,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barium_swallow,List of intestinal diseases,"An upper gastrointestinal series, also called a barium swallow, barium study, or barium meal, is a series of radiographs used to examine the gastrointestinal tract for abnormalities. A contrast medium, usually a radiocontrast agent such as barium sulfate mixed with water, is ingested or instilled into the gastrointestinal tract, and X-rays are used to create radiographs of the regions of interest. The barium enhances the visibility of the relevant parts of the gastrointestinal tract by coating the inside wall of the tract and appearing white on the film. This in combination with other plain radiographs allows for the imaging of parts of the upper gastrointestinal tract such as the pharynx, larynx, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine such that the inside wall lining, size, shape, contour, and patency are visible to the examiner. With fluoroscopy, it is also possible to visualize the functional movement of examined organs such as swallowing, peristalsis, or sphincter closure. Depending on the organs to be examined, barium radiographs can be classified into ""barium swallow"", ""barium meal"", ""barium follow-through"", and ""enteroclysis"" (""small bowel enema""). To further enhance the quality of images, air or gas is sometimes introduced into the gastrointestinal tract in addition to barium, and this procedure is called double-contrast imaging. In this case the gas is referred to as the negative contrast medium. Traditionally the images produced with barium contrast are made with plain-film radiography, but computed tomography is also used in combination with barium contrast, in which case the procedure is called ""CT enterography"".[1]

The serous membrane that covers internal organs (viscera) is called visceral, while the one that covers the cavity wall is called parietal. For instance the parietal peritoneum  is attached to the abdominal wall and the pelvic walls.[2] The visceral peritoneum is wrapped around the visceral organs. For the heart, the layers of the serous membrane are called parietal and visceral pericardium. For the lungs they are called parietal and visceral pleura.

In the stomach a chemical breakdown of food takes place by means of secreted  digestive enzymes and gastric acid. It also plays a role in regulating gut microbiota, influencing digestion and overall health. The stomach is also called the gaster (Greek belly) or venter, from which we have the adjective gastric applied to structures related to the organ.[3]

It remains a serious condition which causes significant mortality and morbidity. It is also the inability to establish and sustain adequate or spontaneous respiration upon delivery of the newborn, an emergency condition that requires adequate and quick resuscitation measures. Perinatal asphyxia is also an oxygen deficit from the 28th week of gestation to the first seven days following delivery. It is also an insult to the fetus or newborn due to lack of oxygen or lack of perfusion to various organs and may be associated with a lack of ventilation. In accordance with WHO, perinatal asphyxia is characterised by: profound metabolic acidosis, with a pH less than 7.20 on umbilical cord arterial blood sample, persistence of an Apgar score of 3 at the 5th minute, clinical neurologic sequelae in the immediate neonatal period, or evidence of multiorgan system dysfunction in the immediate neonatal period. Hypoxic damage can occur to most of the infant's organs (heart, lungs, liver, gut, kidneys), but brain damage is of most concern and perhaps the least likely to quickly or completely heal.

Aseptic meningitis is caused by viruses, mycobacteria, spirochetes, fungi, medications, and cancer malignancies.[1] The testing for both meningitis and aseptic meningitis is mostly the same. A cerebrospinal fluid sample is taken by lumbar puncture and is tested for leukocyte levels to determine if there is an infection and goes on to further testing to see what the actual cause is. The symptoms are the same for both meningitis and aseptic meningitis but the severity of the symptoms and the treatment can depend on the certain cause.

The main difficulty is in saccade initiation, but there is also impaired cancellation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Patients have to turn their head in order to compensate for the lack of eye movement initiation in order to follow an object or see objects in their peripheral vision, but they often exceed their target. There is controversy regarding whether OMA should be considered an apraxia, since apraxia is the inability to perform a learned or skilled motor action to command, and saccade initiation is neither a learned nor a skilled action.[3]

"Apraxia, Ideomotor","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apraxia,_Ideomotor",A,"Ideomotor Apraxia, often IMA, is a neurological disorder characterized by the inability to correctly imitate hand gestures and voluntarily mime tool use, e.g. pretend to brush one's hair. The ability to spontaneously use tools, such as brushing one's hair in the morning without being instructed to do so, may remain intact, but is often lost.  The general concept of apraxia and the classification of ideomotor apraxia were developed in Germany in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by the work of Hugo Liepmann,  Adolph Kussmaul,  Arnold Pick,  Paul Flechsig, Hermann Munk, Carl Nothnagel, Theodor Meynert,  and linguist Heymann Steinthal, among others. Ideomotor apraxia was classified as ""ideo-kinetic apraxia"" by Liepmann due to the apparent dissociation of the idea of the action with its execution.[1] The classifications of the various subtypes are not well defined at present, however, owing to issues of diagnosis and pathophysiology. Ideomotor apraxia is hypothesized to result from a disruption of the system that relates stored tool use and gesture information with the state of the body to produce the proper motor output. This system is thought to be related to the areas of the brain most often seen to be damaged when ideomotor apraxia is present: the left parietal lobe and the premotor cortex. Little can be done at present to reverse the motor deficit seen in ideomotor apraxia, although the extent of dysfunction it induces is not entirely clear.

Aortic coarctation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_coarctation,A,"Coarctation of the aorta (CoA)[1][2] is a congenital condition whereby the aorta is narrow, usually in the area where the ductus arteriosus (ligamentum arteriosum after regression) inserts. The word coarctation means ""pressing or drawing together; narrowing"". Coarctations are most common in the aortic arch. The arch may be small in babies with coarctations. Other heart defects may also occur when coarctation is present, typically occurring on the left side of the heart. When a patient has a coarctation, the left ventricle has to work harder. Since the aorta is narrowed, the left ventricle must generate a much higher pressure than normal in order to force enough blood through the aorta to deliver blood to the lower part of the body. If the narrowing is severe enough, the left ventricle may not be strong enough to push blood through the coarctation, thus resulting in a lack of blood to the lower half of the body. Physiologically its complete form is manifested as interrupted aortic arch.[citation needed]

Antihypertensive drugs antenatal infection,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihypertensive_drugs_antenatal_infection,A,"
Antihypertensives are a class of drugs that are used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).[1] Antihypertensive therapy seeks to prevent the complications of high blood pressure, such as stroke, heart failure, kidney failure and myocardial infarction. Evidence suggests that a reduction of blood pressure by 5 mmHg can decrease the risk of stroke by 34% and of ischaemic heart disease by 21%. It can reduce the likelihood of dementia, heart failure, and mortality from cardiovascular disease.[2] There are many classes of antihypertensives, which lower blood pressure by different means. Among the most important and most widely used medications are thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), angiotensin II receptor blockers or antagonists (ARBs), and beta blockers.

Andersen's disease,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andersen%27s_disease,A,"Glycogen storage disease type IV (GSD IV), or Andersen's Disease,[2][3] is a form of glycogen storage disease, which is caused by an inborn error of metabolism. It is the result of a mutation in the GBE1 gene, which causes a defect in the glycogen branching enzyme. Therefore, glycogen is not made properly, and abnormal glycogen molecules accumulate in cells; most severely in cardiac and muscle cells. The severity of this disease varies on the amount of enzyme produced. GSD IV is autosomal recessive, which means each parent has a mutant copy of the gene but shows no symptoms of the disease. Having an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, males and females are equally likely to be affected by Andersen's disease. Classic Andersen's disease typically becomes apparent during the first few months after the patient is born. Approximately 1 in 20,000 to 25,000 newborns have a glycogen storage disease.[4] Andersen's disease affects 1 in 800,000 individuals worldwide, with 3% of all GSDs being type IV.[5] The disease was described and studied first by Dorothy Hansine Andersen.[6][7]

Alternating hemiplegia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_hemiplegia,A,"Alternating hemiplegia (also known as crossed hemiplegia) is a form of hemiplegia that has an ipsilateral cranial nerve palsies and contralateral hemiplegia or hemiparesis of extremities of the body. The disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of paralysis on one side of the body.[1] There are multiple forms of alternating hemiplegia, Weber's syndrome, middle alternating hemiplegia, and inferior alternating hemiplegia.  This type of syndrome can result from a unilateral lesion in the brainstem affecting both upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons.  The muscles that would receive signals from these damaged upper motor neurons result in spastic paralysis.  With a lesion in the brainstem, this affects the majority of limb and trunk muscles on the contralateral side due to the upper motor neurons decussation after the brainstem.  The cranial nerves and cranial nerve nuclei are also located in the brainstem making them susceptible to damage from a brainstem lesion.  Cranial nerves III (Oculomotor), VI (Abducens), and XII (Hypoglossal) are most often associated with this syndrome given their close proximity with the pyramidal tract, the location which upper motor neurons are in on their way to the spinal cord.  Damages to these structures produce the ipsilateral presentation of paralysis or palsy due to the lack of cranial nerve decussation (aside from the trochlear nerve) before innervating their target muscles. The paralysis may be brief or it may last for several days, many times the episodes will resolve after sleep. Some common symptoms of alternating hemiplegia are mental impairment, gait and balance difficulties, excessive sweating and changes in body temperature.[1]

Homogentisic acid and its oxidized form alkapton are excreted in the urine, giving it an unusually dark color. The accumulating homogentisic acid causes damage to cartilage (ochronosis, leading to osteoarthritis) and heart valves, as well as precipitating as kidney stones and stones in other organs. Symptoms usually develop in people over 30 years old, although the dark discoloration of the urine is present from birth.

Some adenomas grow from epithelial tissue in nonglandular areas but express glandular tissue structure (as can happen in familial polyposis coli). Although adenomas are benign, they should be treated as pre-cancerous. Over time adenomas may transform to become malignant, at which point they are called adenocarcinomas. Most adenomas do not transform. However, even though benign, they have the potential to cause serious health complications by compressing other structures (mass effect) and by producing large amounts of hormones in an unregulated, non-feedback-dependent manner (causing paraneoplastic syndromes).

Adenocarcinoid tumor,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoid_tumor,A,"Adenocarcinoma[1] (/ˌædɪnoʊkɑːrsɪˈnoʊmə/; plural adenocarcinomas or adenocarcinomata /ˌædɪnoʊkɑːrsɪˈnoʊmətə/; AC) is a type of cancerous tumor that can occur in several parts of the body. It is defined as neoplasia of epithelial tissue that has glandular origin, glandular characteristics, or both. Adenocarcinomas are part of the larger grouping of carcinomas, but are also sometimes called by more precise terms omitting the word, where these exist. Thus invasive ductal carcinoma, the most common form of breast cancer, is adenocarcinoma but does not use the term in its name—however, esophageal adenocarcinoma does to distinguish it from the other common type of esophageal cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Several of the most common forms of cancer are adenocarcinomas, and the various sorts of adenocarcinoma vary greatly in all their aspects, so that few useful generalizations can be made about them.

Adenoma,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoma,A,"An adenoma is a benign tumor of epithelial tissue with glandular origin, glandular characteristics, or both. Adenomas can grow from many glandular organs, including the adrenal glands, pituitary gland, thyroid, prostate, and others. Some adenomas grow from epithelial tissue in nonglandular areas but express glandular tissue structure (as can happen in familial polyposis coli). Although adenomas are benign, they should be treated as pre-cancerous. Over time adenomas may transform to become malignant, at which point they are called adenocarcinomas. Most adenomas do not transform. However, even though benign, they have the potential to cause serious health complications by compressing other structures (mass effect) and by producing large amounts of hormones in an unregulated, non-feedback-dependent manner (causing paraneoplastic syndromes). Some adenomas are too small to be seen macroscopically but can still cause clinical symptoms.[citation needed]

ADAM complex,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADAM_complex,A,"Constriction ring syndrome (CRS) is a congenital disorder with unknown cause. Because of the unknown cause there are many different, and sometimes incorrect, names. It is a malformation due to intrauterine bands or rings that produce deep grooves in (most commonly distal) extremities such as fingers and toes. In rare cases the constriction ring can form around other parts of the fetus and cause amputation or even intrauterine death. The anatomy proximal to the site of constriction (or amputation) is developmentally normal.[2][3][4]
CRS can be associated with other malformations, with club foot being most common.[5][6][7]
The precise configuration of the bands, lymphedema, and character of the amputations are not predictable and vary with each individual patient. Also, more than one extremity is usually affected, and it is rare for only one ring to present as an isolated malformation with no other manifestation of this syndrome.[2][3][8][9]

Acute tubular necrosis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_tubular_necrosis,A,"Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a medical condition involving the death of tubular epithelial cells that form the renal tubules of the kidneys. Because necrosis is often not present, the term acute tubular injury (ATI) is preferred by pathologists over the older name acute tubular necrosis (ATN).[1] ATN presents with acute kidney injury (AKI) and is one of the most common causes of AKI.[2] Common causes of ATN include low blood pressure and use of nephrotoxic drugs.[2] The presence of ""muddy brown casts"" of epithelial cells found in the urine during urinalysis is pathognomonic for ATN.[3] Management relies on aggressive treatment of the factors that precipitated ATN (e.g. hydration and cessation of the offending drug). Because the tubular cells continually replace themselves, the overall prognosis for ATN is quite good if the underlying cause is corrected, and recovery is likely within 7 to 21 days.[2]

Acrocyanosis,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrocyanosis,A,"Acrocyanosis is persistent blue or cyanotic discoloration of the extremities, most commonly occurring in the hands, although it also occurs in the feet and distal parts of the face.[1][2][3][4] Although described over 100 years ago and not uncommon in practice, the nature of this phenomenon is still uncertain.[5] The very term ""acrocyanosis"" is often applied inappropriately in cases when blue discoloration of the hands, feet, or parts of the face is noted.[1]
The principal (primary) form of acrocyanosis is that of a benign cosmetic condition,[2] sometimes caused by a relatively benign neurohormonal disorder.[3] Regardless of its cause, the benign form typically does not require medical treatment. A medical emergency would ensue if the extremities experience prolonged periods of exposure to the cold, particularly in children and patients with poor general health.[3] However, frostbite differs from acrocyanosis because pain (via thermal nociceptors) often accompanies the former condition, while the latter is very rarely associated with pain. There are also a number of other conditions that affect hands, feet, and parts of the face with associated skin color changes that need to be differentiated from acrocyanosis: Raynaud phenomenon, pernio, acrorygosis, erythromelalgia, and blue finger syndrome. The diagnosis may be challenging in some cases, especially when these syndromes co-exist.[1]
